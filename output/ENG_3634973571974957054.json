The violinist then received his first dollar tip from a woman who tossed money into his violin case and kept walking without stopping to listen. Six minutes into the performance, a man finally stopped to lean against a wall. He listened for about three minutes before leaving. A three-year-old boy briefly stopped to watch the violinist, but his mother hurried him along. Several other children repeated the action and wanted to listen.",

He played for about forty-five minutes, performing a total of six classical pieces, including pieces from Bach, Massenet, Schubert, and Ponce. During this rush hour, more than a thousand people were estimated to pass through the station. After the first three minutes of playing, a middle-aged man turned his head toward the violinist ① <u>while</u> continuing to his destination. The violinist then received his first dollar tip from a woman who tossed money into his violin case and kept walking without stopping to listen. Six minutes into the performance, a man finally stopped ② <u>to lean</u> against a wall. He listened for about three minutes before leaving. A three-year-old boy briefly stopped to watch the violinist, but his mother hurried him along. Several other children repeated the action and wanted to listen. All the parents encouraged their children ③ <u>to keep</u> moving on this busy morning. In this forty-five-minute performance, a total of seven people stopped and stayed to listen. Twenty-seven people gave him money; most of them just passed by without stopping. The violinist made a total of &#36;32 that morning. When the violinist finished ④ <u>playing</u>, silence filled the station. There was no applause or cheering from a crowd. Only one woman recognized that he was Joshua Bell, one of the best musicians in the classical music world. Three days before this morning performance, he sold out a theater in Boston with seats ⑤ <u>averaged</u> about &#36;100 per ticket. If the people in that station missed a performance from one of the best musicians in the world, what other things are they missing? There is so much in the world around us. We just have to look up and take notice.",

On the other hand, the majority of citizens do not list the environment as one of their top priorities. Yet matters related to the environment, such as climate change, __________. For example, climate change affects natural resources, and when these become scarce, conflicts emerge and threaten our national security. Moreover, as temperatures rise, virus-carrying mosquitoes increase in numbers and cause serious health concerns, such as an increase in the number of malaria cases. Furthermore, focusing on resolving the climate change issue has been shown to have beneficial effects on the economy by leading to faster progress in technology and the creation of new jobs.",

The only sound she could hear was the violent roar of the wind. Still, she continued to call out to Charles. She turned her ear to the waves and listened carefully, but there was no reply. After some time, she dropped to the ground and began to sob as the cold rain poured down on her. Just then, she saw a small, blinking light, and suddenly, her heart filled with excitement. The light was coming from Charles's boat, and on it, Liz could see someone waving to her. Realizing that Charles was alive, Liz's worries instantly melted away.",

On the other hand, the majority of citizens do not list the environment as one of their top priorities. Yet <u>환경과 관련된 문제들이 우리 사회에 직접적인 영향력을 미친다</u>. For example, climate change affects natural resources, and when these become scarce, conflicts emerge and threaten our national security. Moreover, as temperatures rise, virus-carrying mosquitoes increase in numbers and cause serious health concerns, such as an increase in the number of malaria cases. Furthermore, focusing on resolving the climate change issue has been shown to have beneficial effects on the economy by leading to faster progress in technology and the creation of new jobs.",

            "text": "On a weekday morning in January, a man at a metro station in Washington, D.C., started to play the violin. He played for about forty-five minutes, performing a total of six classical pieces, including pieces from Bach, Massenet, Schubert, and Ponce. During this rush hour, more than a thousand people were estimated to pass through the station. After the first three minutes of playing, a middle-aged man turned his head toward the violinist while continuing to his destination. The violinist then received his first dollar tip from a woman <u>그녀는 돈을 그의 바이올린 케이스에 던지고 계속 걸어갔다 듣기위해 멈추지 않고서</u>. Six minutes into the performance, a man finally stopped to lean against a wall. He listened for about three minutes before leaving. A three-year-old boy briefly stopped to watch the violinist, but his mother hurried him along. Several other children repeated the action and wanted to listen. All the parents encouraged their children to keep moving on this busy morning. In this forty-five-minute performance, a total of seven people stopped and stayed to listen. Twenty-seven people gave him money; most of them just passed by without stopping. The violinist made a total of &nbsp32 that morning. When the violinist finished playing, silence filled the station. There was no applause or cheering from a crowd. Only one woman recognized that he was Joshua Bell, one of the best musicians in the classical music world. Three days before this morning performance, he sold out a theater in Boston with seats averaging about &nbsp100 per ticket. If the people in that station missed a performance from one of the best musicians in the world, what other things are they missing? There is so much in the world around us. We just have to look up and take notice.",

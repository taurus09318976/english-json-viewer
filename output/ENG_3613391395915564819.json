This was the first school for the advanced education of people who were deaf and hard-of-hearing. In 1894, it was renamed Gallaudet College, and, in 1986, it became Gallaudet University, as it is known today. A large student protest occurred at the university in 1988, when a new university president was selected and a non-deaf candidate was chosen over several deaf candidates. Students were outraged at the fact that the school had never been led by a deaf administrator. They voiced their opposition to the decision, finding it inappropriate and offensive.",

In 1937, he made La Grande Illusion, one of his better-known films. It was enormously successful but was not allowed to show in Germany. During World War II, when the Nazis invaded France in 1940, he went to Hollywood in the United States and continued his career there. He was awarded numerous honors and awards throughout his career, including the Academy Honorary Award in 1975 for his lifetime achievements in the film industry.

When the Crimean War began, she went to London to help out as a nurse. However, she was rejected because of her race. Instead of returning to Jamaica, Seacole went to Crimea at her own expense. There, in 1855, she opened the British Hotel. She often packed food and medicine onto mules at the hotel and led them to the battlefields, where she was given special passes that allowed her to take care of wounded soldiers from both sides. She was admired for her brave efforts, but her hotel lost money. When she returned to London in 1856, she was bankrupt. However, local newspapers started the Seacole Fund to help her, eventually raising enough money to allow her to live comfortably for the rest of her life.",

He was sent to Berlin to study piano and stayed there from the age of 10 until the age of 13. His American debut was at Carnegie Hall in 1906. However, this performance earned him little acclaim. He later explained that he had relied on his natural abilities __________. His attitude changed after he got married in 1932. He began to practice for up to 12 hours daily. Finally, in 1937, he felt ready to return to Carnegie Hall. This time, critics agreed that he had transformed into an outstanding performer. Rubinstein's reputation continued to grow until his last performance, at the age of 89, in London.",

However, the complex suffered from financial struggles in the 1980s, when its key economic sources declined rapidly. The mining and manufacturing sectors collapsed, and the city's pollution problem became disastrous. When Spain entered the European Community (EC) in 1986, the complex was shut down and completely abandoned. This halt caused several serious social problems, including an increase in the unemployment rate. Urban planners' response to these issues was to design an unprecedented urban regeneration program, the \"Abandoibarra project,\" which focused on high-quality architecture. This program has become famous as __________.",

Shortly after, Arany became a member of the group, and he would go on to serve as its director in 1860. He was also elected as a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 1858 and held a leadership role there for many years. Since his death in 1882, Arany has been regarded as one of Hungary's greatest national poets, and his work has also been recognized globally for its contribution to modern literature.

He was also a well-known advocate for disability rights worldwide, in particular through his work with the United Nations and his leadership of the organization Disabled Peoples' International. When Enns was 15, he was diagnosed with an auto-immune disease and became interested in issues that people with physical disabilities face. In the 1980s, Enns helped found and direct some of the first independent living centers in Ontario and Manitoba. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, he became increasingly active internationally, and he served as the executive director of Disabled People's International from 1990 to 1996. He helped found the Canadian Centre on Disability Studies and was serving as its executive director when he passed away in 2002. He received the President's Award for Humanitarian Service in 1992 and was the first non-U.S. citizen to do so.",

The manuscript was not published at the time, but it came to the attention of Urbain Le Verrier, the director of the Paris Observatory. He became an assistant to Le Verrier in 1858 and worked as a calculator. At nineteen, he wrote another book called The Plurality of Inhabited Worlds, in which he passionately claimed that life exists outside the planet Earth. His most successful work, Popular Astronomy, was published in 1880, and eventually sold 130,000 copies. <u>그는 자신의 자금으로 Juvisy에 천문대를 세웠고, 매년 5월에서 11월까지 그곳 에서 지냈다</u>.",

Shortly after, Arany became a member of the group, and he would go on to serve as its director in 1860. He was also elected as a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 1858 and held a leadership role there for many years.

In the 1980s, Enns helped found and direct some of the first independent living centers in Ontario and Manitoba. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, he became increasingly active internationally, and he served as the executive director of Disabled People's International from 1990 to 1996. He helped found the Canadian Centre on Disability Studies and was serving as its executive director when he passed away in 2002. <u>그는 1992년에 the President's Award for Humanitarian Service를 받았는데, 그 상을 받은 최초의 미국 비시민권자였다</u>.",

In the 1800s, Abandoibarra was responsible for 20 percent of the world's production of steel. However, the complex suffered from financial struggles in the 1980s, when its key economic sources declined rapidly. The mining and manufacturing sectors collapsed, and the city's pollution problem became disastrous. When Spain entered the European Community (EC) in 1986, the complex was shut down and completely abandoned. This halt caused several serious social problems, including an increase in the unemployment rate. Urban planners' response to these issues was to design an unprecedented urban regeneration program, the \"Abandoibarra project,\" which focused on high-quality architecture. This program has become famous as an unparalleled example of urban revival.",

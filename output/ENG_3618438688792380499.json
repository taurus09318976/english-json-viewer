Great Britain's 2012 and 2016 Olympic teams even developed a special program to help athletes maintain focus during high-pressure situations. Top coaches in many different sports unexpectedly change the training environment to help athletes learn to perform well under any circumstances. For example, a soccer coach might make right-footed players use only their left foot to kick the ball during a practice. The coach of the Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps once broke his goggles before a race, making him compete without being able to see clearly. Although it might sound strange, this experience proved to be useful. During an Olympic race in 2008, Phelps's goggles filled with water. He didn't panic and just kept swimming. He ended up winning the gold medal and even setting a new world record!",

            "text": "European rabbits were first brought to Australia in 1859 to be hunted for sport. However, their introduction was quickly followed by an enormous increase in their numbers throughout the continent. Because European rabbits are extremely disruptive to Australia's local environments, scientists have long been trying to get their populations under control. One of the most promising methods has been biological control, which has been attempted by spreading both the myxoma virus and rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) throughout the rabbit populations. Although their numbers initially declined in both cases, the rabbits eventually developed immunity, making the viruses ineffective. In order to protect Australia's local environments, a different method will be required. Some experts have suggested that a combination of methods should be used, claiming that any one method by itself will be less effective than two or more put into practice at the same time.",

So why do we enjoy experiencing these feelings in our entertainment? The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle wondered about this too. His answer was something he called \"catharsis.\" It is a way of removing unpleasant emotions, such as pity and fear, from our bodies. He based this idea on the work of Hippocrates, the greatest physician in ancient Greece. Hippocrates believed that illnesses can be caused by a misbalance in our body. Aristotle decided that this kind of misbalance could occur in the soul as well. According to Aristotle, in order to rebalance the soul, we need a way of safely experiencing bad feelings and getting them out. This is why he considered tragedy to be the greatest form of drama. The pity and fear it causes leave us free of suppressed emotions.",

            "text": "These days, everyone is concerned about financial security. Worries about debt endlessly occupy our thoughts. We have been focused on ourselves for too long, always thinking about what we want and ignoring the people around us. Success in the modern world requires a lifetime of hard work, but true success never seems to come. If our purpose in life was to cooperate with others rather than to constantly compete with them, we would see new possibilities in front of us. When we recognize that true security is simply having enough to get by, then we can stop worrying and begin to enjoy the wonders of life. This kind of life is available to everyone—no gates, no tickets to purchase. You simply need to appreciate what you have and embrace whatever life offers you. Ultimately, a society based on the enjoyment of life has a greater chance of thriving than one based on material growth.",

We have been focused on ourselves for too long, always thinking about what we want and ignoring the people around us. Success in the modern world requires a lifetime of hard work, but true success never seems to come. If our purpose in life was to cooperate with others rather than to constantly compete with them, we would see new possibilities in front of us. When we recognize that true security is simply having enough to get by, then we can stop worrying and begin to enjoy the wonders of life. This kind of life is available to everyone—no gates, no tickets to purchase. <u>당신은 단지 당신이 가진 것에 감사하고, 인생이 당신에게 주는 것은 무엇이든 받아들이기만 하면 된다</u>.",

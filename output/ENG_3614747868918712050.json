The grandmother nodded, took the girl by the hand, and ① <u>walk</u> her to a nearby plant nursery. There, the two of them chose and purchased two small trees. They returned home and planted one of them in the back yard and planted the other tree in a pot and kept it indoors. Then her grandmother asked her which of the trees she thought would be more successful in the future. Yolanda thought for a moment and said the indoor tree would be more successful because it was protected and safe, while the outdoor tree ② <u>should have coped</u> with the elements. Her grandmother shrugged and said, \"We'll see.\" Her grandmother took good care of both trees. In a few years, Yolanda, now a teenager, came to visit her grandmother again. Yolanda reminded her that she had never really answered her question from when she was a little girl about how she could become successful when she grew up. The grandmother showed Yolanda the indoor tree and then took her outside to have a look at the towering tree outside. \"Which one is greater?\" the grandmother asked. Yolanda replied, \"The outside one. But that doesn't make sense; it had to cope with many more challenges than the one inside.\" The grandmother smiled and said, \"Remember this, and you will be successful in whatever you do: If you choose the safe option all of your life, you will never grow. But if you are willing to face the world with all of its challenges, you will learn from those challenges and grow to achieve great heights.\" Yolanda looked up at the tall tree, took a deep breath, and nodded her head, ③ <u>realize</u> that her wise grandmother was right.",

While the class got ready backstage, their families found seats. Soon, the lights dimmed, the music started, and the students came out through the curtains and began to dance. But then an older boy climbed onto the stage. \"Who is he?\" the parents asked each other. Mr. Clark gasped in surprise as the boy began to dance near the younger kids. He was about to stop the performance so that he could ask him ① <u>leave</u>. But then he noticed something. One of his students, a little girl named Mina, was waving to the boy. She took him by the hand and pulled him over so that he could dance with her! Seeing this, Mr. Clark suddenly remembered that Mina had an older brother who was mentally disabled. 'This must be him!' he thought. He was watching the students and clumsily copying their dance steps. The audience began to complain loudly, but the kindergarteners loved it. They seemed more ② <u>excite</u> than ever, and they danced wonderfully. At the end of the performance, they even made him bow with them. However, some people in the audience were still shouting in confusion, so Mr. Clark ran out onto the stage. \"Let's give a big round of applause for our special guest, Mina's brother!\" The audience began to applaud, ③ <u>hesitant</u> at first, but then loudly and enthusiastically. \"Think about what you've just seen,\" he continued. \"Our students might forget the dance steps they learned, but I hope they will always remember how to accept others.\"",

After paying for his own coffee, he paid for the coffee of the person ① <u>stand</u> behind him in line as well. This experience made him feel good, so he posted a story about it on his blog the next day.\nA short time later, a friend left a comment beneath it. He suggested that Ethan ② <u>used</u> his money to help poor students pay their lunch bills instead. He had gotten the idea after reading about a kid who was denied lunch at school because his parents hadn't paid the previous month's bill. So Ethan called a local elementary school and arranged a meeting with the principal. After explaining the situation, he handed &#36;100 to the man, who accepted it gratefully.\nWhen Ethan asked the principal how much money the students owed in total, he was surprised to hear that it was more than &#36;1,000. He told the principal that he would be back the next week. As soon as he got home, Ethan set up an online account. Then he made another blog post, asking people to donate to the account in order to pay off all of the students' unpaid bills. He raised enough money in a few days.\nBut people kept donating to the account, so he contacted another school and then another. Finally, Ethan decided to start his own nonprofit organization. It now features a website that shows people how they can start their own campaigns to pay lunch bills at a local school. It also gives people the opportunity to sponsor individual students. Thanks to Ethan's great idea, there are now fewer students ③ <u>go</u> hungry at school.",

The grandmother nodded, took the girl by the hand, and walked her to a nearby plant nursery. There, the two of them chose and purchased two small trees. They returned home and planted one of them in the back yard and planted ① <u>other</u> tree in a pot and kept it indoors. Then her grandmother asked her which of the trees she thought would be more successful in the future. Yolanda thought for a moment and said the indoor tree would be more successful because it was protected and safe, while the outdoor tree had to cope with the elements. Her grandmother shrugged and said, \"We'll see.\" Her grandmother took good care of both trees. In a few years, Yolanda, now a teenager, came to visit her grandmother again. Yolanda reminded her that she\n② <u>has never</u> really answered her question from when she was a little girl about how she could become successful when she grew up. The grandmother showed Yolanda the indoor tree and then took her outside to have a look at the towering tree outside. \"Which one is greater?\" the grandmother asked. Yolanda replied, \"The outside one. But that doesn't make sense; it had to cope with many more challenges than the one inside.\" The grandmother smiled and said, \"Remember this, and you will be successful in ③ <u>anything whatever</u> you do: If you choose the safe option all of your life, you will never grow. But if you are willing to face the world with all of its challenges, you will learn from those challenges and grow to achieve great heights.\" Yolanda looked up at the tall tree, took a deep breath, and nodded her head, realizing that her wise grandmother was right.",

While the class got ready backstage, their families found seats. Soon, the lights dimmed, the music started, and the students came out through the curtains and began to dance. But then an older boy climbed onto the stage. \"Who is he?\" the parents asked each other. Mr. Clark gasped in surprise as the boy began to dance near the younger kids. He was about to stop the performance so that he could ask him to leave. But then he noticed something. One of his students, a little girl named Mina, was waving to the boy. She took him by the hand and pulled him over so that he could dance with her! Seeing this, Mr. Clark suddenly remembered that Mina had an older brother who was mentally disabled. 'This must be him!' he thought. He was watching the students and clumsily copying their dance steps. The audience began to complain loudly, but the kindergarteners loved it. They seemed more excited than ever, and they danced wonderfully. At the end of the performance, <u>they even made him bow with them</u>. However, some people in the audience were still shouting in confusion, so Mr. Clark ran out onto the stage. \"Let's give a big round of applause for our special guest, Mina's brother!\" The audience began to applaud, hesitantly at first, but then loudly and enthusiastically. \"Think about what you've just seen,\" he continued. \"Our students might forget the dance steps they learned, but I hope they will always remember how to accept others.\"",

            "text": "One morning, while Ethan was getting his morning coffee, he decided to try something he had read about online. After paying for his own coffee, he paid for the coffee of the person standing behind him in line as well. This experience made him feel good, so he posted a story about it on his blog the next day.\nA short time later, a friend left a comment beneath it. He suggested that Ethan should use his money to help poor students pay their lunch bills instead. He had gotten the idea after reading about a kid who was denied lunch at school because his parents hadn't paid the previous month's bill. So Ethan called a local elementary school and arranged a meeting with the principal. After explaining the situation, he handed &#36;100 to the man, who accepted it gratefully.\nWhen Ethan asked the principal how much money the students owed in total, he was surprised to hear that it was more than &#36;1,000. He told the principal that he would be back the next week. <u>As soon as he got home</u>, Ethan set up an online account. Then he made another blog post, asking people to donate to the account in order to pay off all of the students' unpaid bills. He raised enough money in a few days.\nBut people kept donating to the account, so he contacted another school and then another. Finally, Ethan decided to start his own nonprofit organization. It now features a website that shows people how they can start their own campaigns to pay lunch bills at a local school. It also gives people the opportunity to sponsor individual students. Thanks to Ethan's great idea, there are now fewer students going hungry at school.",

The grandmother nodded, took the girl by the hand, and walked her to a nearby plant nursery. There, the two of them chose and purchased two small trees. They returned home and planted one of them in the back yard and planted the other tree in a pot and kept it indoors. Then her grandmother asked her which of the trees she thought would be more successful in the future. Yolanda thought for a moment and said the indoor tree would be more successful because it was protected and safe, while the outdoor tree had to cope with the elements. Her grandmother shrugged and said, \"We'll see.\" Her grandmother took good care of both trees. In a few years, Yolanda, now a teenager, came to visit her grandmother again. Yolanda reminded her that she had never really answered her question from when she was a little girl about how she could become successful when she grew up. The grandmother showed Yolanda the indoor tree and then took her outside to have a look at the towering tree outside. \"Which one is greater?\" the grandmother asked. Yolanda replied, \"The outside one. But that doesn't make sense; it had to cope with many more challenges than the one inside.\" The grandmother smiled and said, \"Remember this, and you will be successful in whatever you do: __________ all of your life, you will never grow. But if you are willing to face the world with all of its challenges, you will learn from those challenges and grow to achieve great heights.\" Yolanda looked up at the tall tree, took a deep breath, and nodded her head, realizing that her wise grandmother was right.",

While the class got ready backstage, their families found seats. Soon, the lights dimmed, the music started, and the students came out through the curtains and began to dance. But then an older boy climbed onto the stage. \"Who is he?\" the parents asked each other. Mr. Clark gasped in surprise as the boy began to dance near the younger kids. He was about to stop the performance so that he could ask him to leave. But then he noticed something. One of his students, a little girl named Mina, was waving to the boy. She took him by the hand and pulled him over so that he could dance with her! Seeing this, Mr. Clark suddenly remembered that Mina had an older brother who was mentally disabled. 'This must be him!' he thought. He was watching the students and clumsily copying their dance steps. The audience began to complain loudly, but the kindergarteners loved it. They seemed more excited than ever, and they danced wonderfully. At the end of the performance, they even made him bow with them. However, some people in the audience were still shouting in confusion, so Mr. Clark ran out onto the stage. \"Let's give a big round of applause for our special guest, Mina's brother!\" The audience began to applaud, hesitantly at first, but then loudly and enthusiastically. \"Think about what you've just seen,\" he continued. \"Our students might forget the dance steps they learned, but I hope they will always remember __________.\"",

            "text": "One morning, while Ethan was getting his morning coffee, he decided to try something he had read about online. After paying for his own coffee, he paid for the coffee of the person standing behind him in line as well. This experience made him feel good, so he posted a story about it on his blog the next day. A short time later, a friend left a comment beneath it. He suggested that Ethan should use his money to help poor students pay their lunch bills instead. He had gotten the idea after reading about a kid who was denied lunch at school because his parents hadn't paid the previous month's bill. So Ethan called a local elementary school and arranged a meeting with the principal. After explaining the situation, he handed &#36;100 to the man, who accepted it gratefully. When Ethan asked the principal how much money the students owed in total, he was surprised to hear that it was more than &#36;1,000. He told the principal that he would be back the next week. As soon as he got home, Ethan set up an online account. Then he made another blog post, asking people __________ in order to pay off all of the students' unpaid bills. He raised enough money in a few days. But people kept donating to the account, so he contacted another school and then another. Finally, Ethan decided to start his own nonprofit organization. It now features a website that shows people how they can start their own campaigns to pay lunch bills at a local school. It also gives people the opportunity to sponsor individual students. Thanks to Ethan's great idea, there are now fewer students going hungry at school.",

Fiction helps portray everyday situations, feelings, and atmosphere that recreate the historical context. Historical fiction adds \"flesh to the bare bones that historians are able to uncover and by doing so ① <u>provide</u> an account that while not necessarily true provides a clearer indication of past events, circumstances and cultures.\" Fiction adds color, sound, drama to the past, as much as it invents parts of the past. And Robert Rosenstone argues that invention is not the weakness of films, it is their strength. Fiction can allow users to see parts of the past that have never—for lack of archives—been represented. In fact, Gilden Seavey explains that if producers of historical fiction had strongly held the strict academic standards, many historical subjects ② <u>will remain unexploring</u> for lack of appropriate evidence. Historical fiction should, therefore, not be seen as the opposite of professional history, but rather as a challenging representation of the past ③ <u>which</u> both public historians and popular audiences may learn.",

Researchers at Yale University <u>might find</u> the reason for this. The scientists discovered variances in the stomach signaling systems of rats. Indeed, the intensity with which the rats' stomachs sent signals when they were full varied from rat to rat. In some cases, the signal was dull—this caused the rats to continue to eat even after they were full. This type of behavior eventually leads to obesity, which suggests that human obesity may be linked to more than just personal choices. Professor Tamas Horvath argues that the inherent characteristics of the connection between their stomachs and their brains might be causing certain people to consume more than they should.",

Fiction can allow users to see parts of the past that ④ <u>has</u> never—for lack of archives—been represented.

In the study, they found that individuals who gave money, blood, goods, or other forms of assistance because of other-focused motives (giving to reduce another's discomfort) were almost four times more likely to still be giving support one year later than those whose original motivation was to reduce personal distress. This effect likely stems from differences in emotional arousal. The events of September 11th emotionally affected people throughout the United States. Those who gave to reduce others' distress reduced their emotional arousal with their initial gift, discharging that emotional distress. However, those who gave to reduce their own distress did not stop empathizing with victims who continued to struggle long after the attacks.",

Consumers are attracted to these labels because they are morally concerned with the way in which the meat was obtained. However, a study suggests that there is another reason for using such labels. In an experiment, researchers gave participants identical meat samples presented in different ways. One was labeled \"humanely raised,\" and the other was said to be from a factory. Surprisingly, the former was rated as tasting better than the latter. Participants even rated the humane-labeled meat as superior to the factory-labeled samples in terms of smell and look. These results show that there is a lot more to __________ than simply its ingredients.",

Fiction helps portray everyday situations, feelings, and atmosphere that recreate the historical context. Historical fiction adds \"flesh to the bare bones that historians are able to uncover and by doing so provides an account that while not necessarily true provides a clearer indication of past events, circumstances and cultures.\" Fiction adds color, sound, drama to the past, as much as it invents parts of the past. And Robert Rosenstone argues that invention is not the weakness of films, it is their strength. Fiction can allow users to see parts of the past that have never—for lack of archives—been represented. In fact, Gilden Seavey explains that if producers of historical fiction had strongly held the strict academic standards, many historical subjects would remain unexplored for lack of appropriate evidence. Historical fiction should, therefore, not be seen as the opposite of professional history, but rather as a challenging representation of the past from which both public historians and popular audiences may learn.",

Researchers at Yale University may have found the reason for this. The scientists discovered variances in the stomach signaling systems of rats. Indeed, the intensity with which the rats' stomachs sent signals when they were full varied from rat to rat. In some cases, the signal was dull—this caused the rats to continue to eat even after they were full. This type of behavior eventually leads to obesity, which suggests that human obesity may be linked to __________.

In the experiment, people were placed in separate rooms but were given microphones and earphones so that they could communicate with one another. This allowed them to hear each other but not see each other. Next, a recording that imitated the sounds of an epileptic seizure was played, and participants were led to believe that one of the others was suffering the seizure. In some cases, individuals were made to think that he or she was the only person hearing the sounds. In other cases, they were made to think that others could hear it as well. The study showed that participants who believed that they were the only person to hear the sounds were much more likely to leave their room to help than those who believed that others could also hear it. Moreover, as the number of people who were believed to be listening increased, the feeling of individual responsibility lessened accordingly.",

However, some of the \"participants\" were actually actors who had been asked to occasionally select the wrong answer on purpose. After 12 trials, almost one-third of the real participants agreed with the incorrect majority when the actors intentionally chose the wrong answer. In contrast, less than 1 percent of the participants in the experiment's control group, which did not have any actors, ever selected the wrong answer. This experiment demonstrated people's tendency to __________ groups, and it helps to explain why individuals sometimes alter their behavior or their previously held opinions in order to fit in when they are in a social setting.",

Consumers are attracted to these labels because they are morally concerned with the way in which the meat was obtained. However, a study suggests that there is another reason for using such labels. In an experiment, researchers gave participants identical meat samples presented in different ways. One was labeled \"humanely raised,\" and the other was said to be from a factory. Surprisingly, <u>전자가 후자보다 더 좋은 맛이 난다고 평가 되었다</u>. Participants even rated the humane-labeled meat as superior to the factory-labeled samples in terms of smell and look.

            "text": "Two people with similar diets may have very different physical appearances, even if their other activities are also comparable. Researchers at Yale University may have found the reason for this. The scientists discovered variances in the stomach signaling systems of rats. Indeed, <u>그 쥐들의 위장이 신호를 보낸 세기가 완전히 달랐다</u> from rat to rat. In some cases, the signal was dull—this caused the rats to continue to eat even after they were full. This type of behavior eventually leads to obesity, which suggests that human obesity may be linked to more than just personal choices. Professor Tamas Horvath argues that the inherent characteristics of the connection between their stomachs and their brains might be causing certain people to consume more than they should.",

Fiction helps portray everyday situations, feelings, and atmosphere that recreate the historical context. Historical fiction adds \"flesh to the bare bones that historians are able to uncover and by doing so provides an account that while not necessarily true provides a clearer indication of past events, circumstances and cultures.\" Fiction adds color, sound, drama to the past, as much as it invents parts of the past. And Robert Rosenstone argues that invention is not the weakness of films, it is their strength. Fiction can allow users to see parts of the past that have never—for lack of archives—been represented. In fact, Gilden Seavey explains that <u>역사 소설 제작자들이 엄격한 학술적 기준을 고수했다면, 많은 역사적 주제는 적절한 증거의 부족으로 탐구되지 않은 채 남아있을 것이다</u>.",

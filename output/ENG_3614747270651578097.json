This process of fitting new discoveries into existing beliefs is known as \"normal science.\" Sometimes, (b) <b>[ likewise / though ]</b>, it is simply impossible to fit a new discovery into those existing beliefs. In these cases, the new discovery challenges their very foundations. If the discovery is significant enough, it can lead to what we call a \"scientific revolution.\" When this happens, the old beliefs have to be modified so that they are consistent with the new discovery. The new way of viewing and understanding the world that results from this process is called a new \"paradigm.\" Oftentimes, a new paradigm is resisted by the scientific community because it overturns everything that they have long believed in. (c) <b>[ However / Thus ]</b>, these great changes are necessary for science to advance and for our understanding of the world to continue to develop.",

In his 2016 book The Great Derangement, anthropologist and novelist Amitav Ghosh takes on this relationship between imagination and environmental management, arguing that humans have failed to respond to climate change at least in part because fiction fails to believably represent it. Ghosh explains that climate change is largely absent from contemporary fiction because the cyclones, floods, and other catastrophes it brings to mind simply ① <u>to seem</u> too \"improbable\" to belong in stories about everyday life. But climate change does not only reveal itself as a series of extraordinary events. In fact, as environmentalists and ecocritics from Rachel Carson to Rob Nixon have pointed out, environmental change can be \"imperceptible\"; it proceeds gradually, only occasionally producing \"explosive and spectacular\" events. Most climate change impacts cannot be observed day-to-day, but they become visible when we are confronted with their accumulated impacts. Climate change evades our imagination because it poses significant representational challenges. It cannot be observed in \"human time,\" ② <u>it</u> is why documentary filmmaker Jeff Orlowski, who tracks climate change effects on glaciers and coral reefs, ③ <u>using</u> \"before and after\" photographs taken several months apart in the same place to highlight changes that occurred gradually.",

This is highly unlikely, but the money you spend helps run important government programs. In Taiwan, however, there is a different kind of lottery. Called the Uniform Invoice Lottery, it also raises money for the government. The difference is that there is no charge to play this lottery. It was created in the early 1950s. At that time, the Taiwanese government was having trouble ② <u>collect</u> sales taxes. Many businesses would report fewer sales than they had actually made. And since most consumers paid in cash and businesses seldom gave out receipts, it was impossible to catch the cheaters. Therefore, the government came up with an innovative plan. They began to print a lottery number at the top of each receipt. Then, every two months, lottery numbers would be drawn. The person who held the receipt with the matching numbers would be awarded a cash prize. Soon, consumers started to demand receipts for all of their purchases. This forced dishonest businesses to pay their sales tax in full. Within a year, the amount of sales tax ③ <u>collect</u> by the government nearly doubled!",

In his 2016 book The Great Derangement, anthropologist and novelist Amitav Ghosh takes on this relationship between imagination and environmental management, ② <u>arguing</u> that humans have failed to respond to climate change at least in part because fiction fails to believably represent it. Ghosh explains that climate change is largely absent from contemporary fiction because the cyclones, floods, and other catastrophes ③ <u>it brings</u> to mind simply seem too \"improbable\" to belong in stories about everyday life. But climate change does not only reveal ④ <u>itself</u> as a series of extraordinary events. In fact, as environmentalists and ecocritics from Rachel Carson to Rob Nixon have pointed out, environmental change can be \"imperceptible\"; it proceeds gradually, only occasionally producing \"explosive and spectacular\" events. Most climate change impacts cannot be observed day-to-day, but they become visible when we are confronted with their accumulated impacts. Climate change evades our imagination because it poses significant representational challenges. It cannot be observed in \"human time,\" which is why documentary filmmaker Jeff Orlowski, who tracks climate change effects on glaciers and coral reefs, uses \"before and after\" photographs ⑤ <u>were taken</u> several months apart in the same place to highlight changes that occurred gradually.",

            "text": "Climate change experts and environmental humanists alike agree that the climate crisis is, at its core, a crisis of the imagination and much of the popular imagination is shaped by fiction. In his 2016 book The Great Derangement, anthropologist and novelist Amitav Ghosh takes on this relationship between imagination and environmental management, arguing that humans have failed to respond to climate change at least in part because fiction fails to believably represent it. Ghosh explains that climate change is largely absent from contemporary fiction because the cyclones, floods, and other catastrophes it brings to mind simply seem too \"improbable\" to belong in stories about everyday life. But climate change does not only reveal itself as a series of extraordinary events. In fact, as environmentalists and ecocritics from Rachel Carson to Rob Nixon have pointed out, environmental change can be \"imperceptible\"; it proceeds gradually, only occasionally producing \"explosive and spectacular\" events. Most climate change impacts cannot be observed day-to-day, but they become visible when __________. Climate change evades our imagination because it poses significant representational challenges. It cannot be observed in \"human time,\" which is why documentary filmmaker Jeff Orlowski, who tracks climate change effects on glaciers and coral reefs, uses \"before and after\" photographs taken several months apart in the same place to highlight changes that occurred gradually.",

Scientists think that this may cause allergies and asthma, diseases related to an overactive immune system. Therefore, it is believed that we can make our bodies healthier by introducing worms.

This is highly unlikely, but the money you spend helps run important government programs. In Taiwan, however, there is a different kind of lottery. Called the Uniform Invoice Lottery, it also raises money for the government. The difference is that there is no charge to play this lottery. It was created in the early 1950s. At that time, the Taiwanese government was having trouble collecting sales taxes. Many businesses would report fewer sales than they had actually made. And since most consumers paid in cash and businesses seldom gave out receipts, it was impossible to catch the cheaters. Therefore, the government came up with an innovative plan. They began to print a lottery number at the top of each receipt. Then, every two months, lottery numbers would be drawn. The person who held the receipt with the matching numbers would be awarded a cash prize. Soon, consumers started to demand receipts for all of their purchases. This forced dishonest businesses __________ in full. Within a year, the amount of sales tax collected by the government nearly doubled! ",

This worldview is based on certain beliefs that all of these experts agree on. These fundamental beliefs are so important that scientists are very protective of them. When they make new discoveries, they try to fit them into those existing beliefs, even when it is not easy to do so. That is because changing their basic beliefs would mean changing everything that they know. This process of fitting new discoveries into existing beliefs is known as \"normal science.\" Sometimes, though, it is simply impossible to fit a new discovery into those existing beliefs. In these cases, the new discovery challenges their very foundations. If the discovery is significant enough, it can lead to what we call a \"scientific revolution.\" When this happens, the old beliefs have to __________ so that they are consistent with the new discovery. The new way of viewing and understanding the world that results from this process is called a new \"paradigm.\" Oftentimes, a new paradigm is resisted by the scientific community because it overturns everything that they have long believed in. However, these great changes are necessary for science to advance and for our understanding of the world to continue to develop.= =",

In his 2016 book The Great Derangement, anthropologist and novelist Amitav Ghosh takes on this relationship between imagination and environmental management, arguing that humans have failed to respond to climate change at least in part because fiction fails to believably represent it. Ghosh explains that climate change is largely absent from contemporary fiction because <u>그것의 상기시키는 사이클론, 홍수, 그리고 다른 큰 재해들이 일상생활에 관한 이야기에 속하기에는 그저 너무 '있음 직하지 않은’ 것처럼 보인다</u>.",

This is highly unlikely, but the money you spend helps run important government programs. In Taiwan, however, there is a different kind of lottery. Called the Uniform Invoice Lottery, it also raises money for the government. The difference is that there is no charge to play this lottery. It was created in the early 1950s. At that time, the Taiwanese government was having trouble collecting sales taxes. <u>많은 사업체들이 그들이 실제로 한 것보다 더 적은 매출을 보고하곤 했었다</u>.",

What role does the territory play in the metabolic reproduction of the social system's population? Of key significance is the fact that territory offers the population a legitimate physical 'common living space'; that is, it serves as a 'repository for humans and their infrastructures.' This 'repository function' provides the opportunity to participate in the consumption of the so-called 'free goods,' the ecosystem services within the territory (for example, clean air and water). In most cases, however, it means more than this. The state is in some sense answerable to the 'common good' and thus to ensuring conditions supporting the reproduction of its human subjects. In any case, at least within its territory, it must ensure that their metabolic reproduction is possible. The territory is therefore meaningful in containing natural resources that economic processes can appropriate. It also provides an outlet for the depositing of waste products from these processes, and it is a source of various non-provisioning ecosystem services.",

There are classic examples of this within the prison service and of how arrangements can be made for the safety of visitors. But many reception areas for public services have, from time to time, employed security screens in the hope of discouraging violence or abusive behavior and for the protection of staff. These have not always worked, however, and have sometimes given the message that violent behavior is being expected. Some people find such screens to be so impersonal that they provoke a suspicious, even aggressive, response. They much prefer to create an open, warm, and human environment that respects the individual and encourages them in turn to behave respectfully towards the worker. It is also possible that screens can put confidentiality at risk if people feel that they have to speak more loudly in order to make themselves heard. Screens in GP surgeries are good examples of this.",

The object of decoding may be verbal or nonverbal. The nonverbal object, however, becomes in the process of decoding analogous to verbal objects, that is, it is viewed as a set of signals. Decoding an enemy's message begins with the belief that the apparently random signals conceal a coherent meaning. As is the case with explanation, decoding aims to unify disparate facts. While explanation includes the particular covered by a general law, decoding substitutes one element with another in accordance with a rule that may be individual to the particular case: the enemy's second message may or may not be written in the same code as the first. The decoder cannot rely on seemingly similar cases to provide the right code — the apparent similarity may be misleading. By contrast, similar cases must be similarly explained, because explanations assume general, coherent rules common to all relevant cases.",

It is possible to demonstrate this for yourself. You will find you are able to hold your breath for longer if you breathe very rapidly for a short time beforehand. (Do not do this for more than a minute, or you may become dizzy.) The reason is that breath-holding is terminated not by the demand for oxygen but rather by the rising carbon dioxide concentration in the blood. When this reaches a critical level, it stimulates you to take a breath. Hyperventilation before holding your breath blows off carbon dioxide from the body and enables a longer period to go by before carbon dioxide builds up to a level sufficient to stimulate breathing. The opposing drives from oxygen and carbon dioxide explain why no change in breathing occurs at altitudes of less than 3000 meters.",

            "text": "It is perhaps self-evident that the outworking of policy is seen in the exercise of power if it compels individuals to behave in a way they would not have chosen to do. Policy can be used to highlight power relationships, but it can also allow for depersonalization of power and decision-making: a leader could imply that while they don't really agree with a particular course of action, the policy dictates it and therefore it must be done. In the same way, policy can act as the source of authority such that hierarchy is unnecessary: a group of individuals may resort to policy to guide their decision-making when there is no established authority figure to set their direction. Ultimately, those who define policy exert power over those who follow policy and, in education at least, it is rare that policy is determined collectively: at best, leaders are elected democratically so they may set policy for the electorate. There is therefore an inevitable reliance on a political elite and a consequent hierarchy of power. A frequently seen example of policy as power in schools is uniform. It is for the 'governing board' of a school to determine if it has a uniform and, if so, what it is, but parents and children have a duty to comply, and school staff have a duty to enforce it. Countless children will have discovered that they cannot appeal to the logic that inadequate uniform does not affect their learning, nor can they resort to any individual to plead their case, for the power rests within the policy itself: it is sufficient to say that you have to wear school uniforms because that is what the policy says.",

And there is no haggling over the fare: an app charges a precise sum depending on the length of the journey. None of this is inherently objectionable. But scooters do offer a helpful example of the paradox of digital technologies: they offer freedom, but only in exchange for some surrender of control. This is not a paradox that will ever be fully resolved. The question will always be whether the balance between freedom and control is struck in the right place.",

That notion, a linguistic Big Bang, has been championed by linguists such as Noam Chomsky. But it is extremely improbable, biologically speaking, that such a complex characteristic as our capacity for speech just popped up out of nowhere. It is more likely that language evolved in several stages in the same way, for instance, as our large brains did or our tool-making ability. This may have been a process similar to the one children go through, or the process may have been entirely different and involved intermediate forms. But some form of evolution must have occurred on the journey from non-speaking apes to speaking humans. At some point, there must have been linguistic precursors, simpler forms of language. There must also have been a protolanguage, the first one that could be called a language.",

Take, for example, these astounding statistics: at the time of writing this paper, the number of websites currently online is over 1.5 billion, the number of active users on some of the biggest social media platforms is over two billion, and the number of Internet users is over four billion. More specific to consumer-created content, 400 hours of videos are uploaded every minute, and searches of \"how to\" videos are growing 70% year over year on popular video sites. These numbers will likely increase by the time this manuscript goes to print. People today are not simply innocent consumers of information but also providers of information through their own content creation, which is \"the material people contribute to the online world.\" Today, the production and distribution of information is a market in which nearly everyone can, and does, participate.",

The cycle typically starts with a collection of incidental observations and the formulation of a possible explanation for these observations. This explanation is known as a theory. Based on this theory, we can then make predictions about conditions that we have not yet observed. In other words, we can formulate specific hypotheses. Now, we can design an experiment that aims to disprove our theory: when the results of our experiment are consistent with the theory, we have no reason to suspect that anything is wrong with it. When the results are inconsistent, however, we will either have to adjust our theory, or reject it altogether. It is impossible to 'prove' a theory: as long as we find no conflicting evidence, the theory remains plausible. This does not exclude the possibility, however, that there might be future results that will conflict. Although a theory becomes more plausible the more results we find that are consistent with it, it remains the case that (at least in principle) a single experiment yielding conflicting results would be sufficient to overthrow it.",

            "text": "One of the truths about writing in science is that it substantially limits the amount of insincere blather that can emanate from the mind of a student when he/she has absolutely no idea about a correct response. A student who does not have a basic understanding of scientific theories will have immense difficulty in applying them. In responding to an authentic scientific problem through an essay, there is no way to \"luck out\" on a guess at the correct answer; there is no place to hide. In general, essays that require students to invoke relevant scientific principles and theories and to explore potential applications are more genuine assessments of student knowledge than objective tests of short questions paired with possible answers already furnished. Another advantage of writing essays is that the teacher can get a sense of where student comprehension is strong and where understanding begins to break down. After all, writing is a form of concretized thought. Thus, when a student's grasp of a concept begins to get off-track, it is only through those moments when thought is made visible that a teacher is able to identify the problem and provide help. Writing provides the opportunity for the kind of intervention that can prevent conceptual misunderstandings that can haunt a student for their entire academic career. Indeed, Heddy \\& Sinatra (2013) and Francek (2013) have found that one of the most difficult areas of teaching is trying to get students to unlearn a misconception.",

What role does the territory play in the metabolic reproduction of the social system's population? Of key significance is the fact that territory offers the population a legitimate physical 'common living space'; that is, it serves as a 'repository for humans and their infrastructures.' This 'repository function' provides the opportunity to participate in the consumption of the so-called 'free goods,' the ecosystem services within the territory (for example, clean air and water). In most cases, however, it means more than this. The state is in some sense answerable to the 'common good' and thus to ensuring conditions supporting the reproduction of its human subjects. In any case, at least within its territory, it must ensure that their metabolic reproduction is possible. The territory is therefore meaningful in containing natural resources that economic processes can appropriate. It also provides an outlet for the depositing of waste products from these processes, and it is a source of various non-provisioning ecosystem services.",

There are classic examples of this within the prison service and of how arrangements can be made for the safety of visitors. But many reception areas for public services have, from time to time, employed security screens in the hope of discouraging violence or abusive behavior and for the protection of staff. These have not always worked, however, and have sometimes given the message that violent behavior is being expected. Some people find such screens to be so impersonal that they provoke a suspicious, even aggressive, response. They much prefer to create an open, warm, and human environment that respects the individual and encourages them in turn to behave respectfully towards the worker. It is also possible that screens can put confidentiality at risk if people feel that they have to speak more loudly in order to make themselves heard. Screens in GP surgeries are good examples of this.",

The object of decoding may be verbal or nonverbal. The nonverbal object, however, becomes in the process of decoding analogous to verbal objects, that is, it is viewed as a set of signals. Decoding an enemy's message begins with the belief that the apparently random signals conceal a coherent meaning. As is the case with explanation, decoding aims to unify disparate facts. While explanation includes the particular covered by a general law, decoding substitutes one element with another in accordance with a rule that may be individual to the particular case: the enemy's second message may or may not be written in the same code as the first. The decoder cannot rely on seemingly similar cases to provide the right code — the apparent similarity may be misleading. By contrast, similar cases must be similarly explained, because explanations assume general, coherent rules common to all relevant cases.",

It is possible to demonstrate this for yourself. You will find you are able to hold your breath for longer if you breathe very rapidly for a short time beforehand. (Do not do this for more than a minute, or you may become dizzy.) The reason is that breath-holding is terminated not by the demand for oxygen but rather by the rising carbon dioxide concentration in the blood. When this reaches a critical level, it stimulates you to take a breath. Hyperventilation before holding your breath blows off carbon dioxide from the body and enables a longer period to go by before carbon dioxide builds up to a level sufficient to stimulate breathing. The opposing drives from oxygen and carbon dioxide explain why no change in breathing occurs at altitudes of less than 3000 meters.",

            "text": "It is perhaps self-evident that the outworking of policy is seen in the exercise of power if it compels individuals to behave in a way they would not have chosen to do. Policy can be used to highlight power relationships, but it can also allow for depersonalization of power and decision-making: a leader could imply that while they don't really agree with a particular course of action, the policy dictates it and therefore it must be done. In the same way, policy can act as the source of authority such that hierarchy is unnecessary: a group of individuals may resort to policy to guide their decision-making when there is no established authority figure to set their direction. Ultimately, those who define policy exert power over those who follow policy and, in education at least, it is rare that policy is determined collectively: at best, leaders are elected democratically so they may set policy for the electorate. There is therefore an inevitable reliance on a political elite and a consequent hierarchy of power. A frequently seen example of policy as power in schools is uniform. It is for the 'governing board' of a school to determine if it has a uniform and, if so, what it is, but parents and children have a duty to comply, and school staff have a duty to enforce it. Countless children will have discovered that they cannot appeal to the logic that inadequate uniform does not affect their learning, nor can they resort to any individual to plead their case, for the power rests within the policy itself: it is sufficient to say that you have to wear school uniforms because that is what the policy says.",

Scooters are faster than walking, easier than cycling, and simpler than cars. They turn the urban landscape into a playground. Riding them is a carefree experience ― but it is more restrained than it might seem. Every journey is tracked from start to finish. No matter how hard the throttle is pressed, the scooters will not go above a particular speed. They refuse to leave designated urban areas. And there is no haggling over the fare: an app charges a precise sum depending on the length of the journey. None of this is inherently objectionable. But scooters do offer a helpful example of the paradox of digital technologies: they offer freedom, but only in exchange for some surrender of control. This is not a paradox that will ever be fully resolved. The question will always be whether the balance between freedom and control is struck in the right place.",

That notion, a linguistic Big Bang, has been championed by linguists such as Noam Chomsky. But it is extremely improbable, biologically speaking, that such a complex characteristic as our capacity for speech just popped up out of nowhere. It is more likely that language evolved in several stages in the same way, for instance, as our large brains did or our tool-making ability. This may have been a process similar to the one children go through, or the process may have been entirely different and involved intermediate forms. But some form of evolution must have occurred on the journey from non-speaking apes to speaking humans. At some point, there must have been linguistic precursors, simpler forms of language. There must also have been a protolanguage, the first one that could be called a language.",

Today, however, advances in information technology — specifically, computers and telecommunication — have resulted in a situation where information can be created by anyone and can flow from anyone to everyone else. Take, for example, these astounding statistics: at the time of writing this paper, the number of websites currently online is over 1.5 billion, the number of active users on some of the biggest social media platforms is over two billion, and the number of Internet users is over four billion. More specific to consumer-created content, 400 hours of videos are uploaded every minute, and searches of \"how to\" videos are growing 70% year over year on popular video sites. These numbers will likely increase by the time this manuscript goes to print. People today are not simply innocent consumers of information but also providers of information through their own content creation, which is \"the material people contribute to the online world.\" Today, the production and distribution of information is a market in which nearly everyone can, and does, participate.",

The cycle typically starts with a collection of incidental observations and the formulation of a possible explanation for these observations. This explanation is known as a theory. Based on this theory, we can then make predictions about conditions that we have not yet observed. In other words, we can formulate specific hypotheses. Now, we can design an experiment that aims to disprove our theory: when the results of our experiment are consistent with the theory, we have no reason to suspect that anything is wrong with it. When the results are inconsistent, however, we will either have to adjust our theory, or reject it altogether. It is impossible to 'prove' a theory: as long as we find no conflicting evidence, the theory remains plausible. This does not exclude the possibility, however, that there might be future results that will conflict. Although a theory becomes more plausible the more results we find that are consistent with it, it remains the case that (at least in principle) a single experiment yielding conflicting results would be sufficient to overthrow it.",

            "text": "One of the truths about writing in science is that it substantially limits the amount of insincere blather that can emanate from the mind of a student when he/she has absolutely no idea about a correct response. A student who does not have a basic understanding of scientific theories will have immense difficulty in applying them. In responding to an authentic scientific problem through an essay, there is no way to \"luck out\" on a guess at the correct answer; there is no place to hide. In general, essays that require students to invoke relevant scientific principles and theories and to explore potential applications are more genuine assessments of student knowledge than objective tests of short questions paired with possible answers already furnished. Another advantage of writing essays is that the teacher can get a sense of where student comprehension is strong and where understanding begins to break down. After all, writing is a form of concretized thought. Thus, when a student's grasp of a concept begins to get off-track, it is only through those moments when thought is made visible that a teacher is able to identify the problem and provide help. Writing provides the opportunity for the kind of intervention that can prevent conceptual misunderstandings that can haunt a student for their entire academic career. Indeed, Heddy \\& Sinatra (2013) and Francek (2013) have found that one of the most difficult areas of teaching is trying to get students to unlearn a misconception.",

What role does the territory play in the metabolic reproduction of the social system's population? Of key significance is the fact that territory offers the population a legitimate physical 'common living space'; that is, it serves as a 'repository for humans and their infrastructures.' This 'repository function' provides the opportunity to participate in the consumption of the so-called 'free goods,' the ecosystem services within the territory (for example, clean air and water). In most cases, however, it means more than this. The state is in some sense answerable to the 'common good' and thus to ensuring conditions supporting the reproduction of its human subjects. In any case, at least within its territory, it must ensure that their metabolic reproduction is possible. The territory is therefore meaningful in containing natural resources that economic processes can appropriate. It also provides an outlet for the depositing of waste products from these processes, and it is a source of various non-provisioning ecosystem services.",

There are classic examples of this within the prison service and of how arrangements can be made for the safety of visitors.

These have not always worked, however, and have sometimes given the message that violent behavior is being expected. Some people find such screens to be so impersonal that they provoke a suspicious, even aggressive, response. They much prefer to create an open, warm, and human environment that respects the individual and encourages them in turn to behave respectfully towards the worker.

The object of decoding may be verbal or nonverbal. The nonverbal object, (A)__________, becomes in the process of decoding analogous to verbal objects, that is, it is viewed as a set of signals. Decoding an enemy's message begins with the belief that the apparently random signals conceal a coherent meaning. As is the case with explanation, decoding aims to unify disparate facts. While explanation includes the particular covered by a general law, decoding substitutes one element with another in accordance with a rule that may be individual to the particular case: the enemy's second message may or may not be written in the same code as the first. The decoder cannot rely on seemingly similar cases to provide the right code — the apparent similarity may be misleading.

It is possible to demonstrate this for yourself. You will find you are able to hold your breath for longer if you breathe very rapidly for a short time beforehand. (Do not do this for more than a minute, or you may become dizzy.) The reason is that breath-holding is terminated not by the demand for oxygen but rather by the rising carbon dioxide concentration in the blood. When this reaches a critical level, it stimulates you to take a breath. Hyperventilation before holding your breath blows off carbon dioxide from the body and enables a longer period to go by before carbon dioxide __________. The opposing drives from oxygen and carbon dioxide explain why no change in breathing occurs at altitudes of less than 3000 meters.",

Scooters are faster than walking, easier than cycling, and simpler than cars. They turn the urban landscape into a playground. Riding them is a carefree experience — but it is more restrained than it might seem. Every journey is tracked from start to finish. No matter how hard the throttle is pressed, the scooters will not go above a particular speed. They refuse to leave designated urban areas. And there is no haggling over the fare: an app charges a precise sum depending on the length of the journey. None of this is inherently objectionable. But scooters do offer a helpful example of the paradox of digital technologies: they offer freedom, but only in exchange for __________. This is not a paradox that will ever be fully resolved. The question will always be whether the balance between freedom and control is struck in the right place.",

Today, however, advances in information technology — specifically, computers and telecommunication — have resulted in a situation where information can be created by anyone and can flow from anyone to everyone else. Take, for example, these astounding statistics: at the time of writing this paper, the number of websites currently online is over 1.5 billion, the number of active users on some of the biggest social media platforms is over two billion, and the number of Internet users is over four billion. More specific to consumer-created content, 400 hours of videos are uploaded every minute, and searches of \"how to\" videos are growing 70\\% year over year on popular video sites. These numbers will likely increase by the time this manuscript goes to print. People today are not simply innocent consumers of information but also __________. Today, the production and distribution of information is a market in which nearly everyone can, and does, participate.",

Take, (B)__________, these astounding statistics: at the time of writing this paper, the number of websites currently online is over 1.5 billion, the number of active users on some of the biggest social media platforms is over two billion, and the number of Internet users is over four billion. More specific to consumer-created content, 400 hours of videos are uploaded every minute, and searches of \"how to\" videos are growing 70% year over year on popular video sites. These numbers will likely increase by the time this manuscript goes to print. People today are not simply innocent consumers of information but also providers of information through their own content creation, which is \"the material people contribute to the online world.\" Today, the production and distribution of information is a market in which nearly everyone can, and does, participate.",

The cycle typically starts with a collection of incidental observations and the formulation of a possible explanation for these observations. This explanation is known as a theory. Based on this theory, we can then __________. In other words, we can formulate specific hypotheses. Now, we can design an experiment that aims to disprove our theory: when the results of our experiment are consistent with the theory, we have no reason to suspect that anything is wrong with it. When the results are inconsistent, however, we will either have to adjust our theory, or reject it altogether. It is impossible to 'prove' a theory: as long as we find no conflicting evidence, the theory remains plausible. This does not exclude the possibility, however, that there might be future results that will conflict. Although a theory becomes more plausible the more results we find that are consistent with it, it remains the case that (at least in principle) a single experiment yielding conflicting results would be sufficient to overthrow it.",

The cycle typically starts with a collection of incidental observations and the formulation of a possible explanation for these observations. This explanation is known as a theory. Based on this theory, we can then make predictions about conditions that we have not yet observed. In other words, we can formulate specific hypotheses. (A)__________, we can design an experiment that aims to disprove our theory: when the results of our experiment are consistent with the theory, we have no reason to suspect that anything is wrong with it. When the results are inconsistent, however, we will either have to adjust our theory, or reject it altogether. It is impossible to 'prove' a theory: as long as we find no conflicting evidence, the theory remains plausible. This does not exclude the possibility, (B) __________, that there might be future results that will conflict. Although a theory becomes more plausible the more results we find that are consistent with it, it remains the case that (at least in principle) a single experiment yielding conflicting results would be sufficient to overthrow it.",

What role does the territory play in the metabolic reproduction of the social system's population? Of key significance is the fact that territory offers the population a legitimate physical 'common living space'; that is, it serves as a 'repository for humans and their infrastructures.' This 'repository function' provides the opportunity to participate in the consumption of the so-called 'free goods,' the ecosystem services within the territory (for example, clean air and water). In most cases, however, it means more than this. The state is in some sense answerable to the 'common good' and thus to ensuring conditions supporting the reproduction of its human subjects. In any case, at least within its territory, it must ensure that their metabolic reproduction is possible. The territory is therefore meaningful in containing natural resources that economic processes can appropriate. It also provides an outlet for the depositing of waste products from these processes, and it is a source of various non-provisioning ecosystem services.",

It is possible to demonstrate this for yourself. You will find you are able to hold your breath for longer if you breathe very rapidly for a short time beforehand. (Do not do this for more than a minute, or you may become dizzy.) The reason is that breath-holding is terminated not by the demand for oxygen but rather by the rising carbon dioxide concentration in the blood. When this reaches a critical level, it stimulates you to take a breath. Hyperventilation before holding your breath blows off carbon dioxide from the body and enables a longer period to go by before carbon dioxide builds up to a level sufficient to stimulate breathing. The opposing drives from oxygen and carbon dioxide explain why no change in breathing occurs at altitudes of less than 3000 meters.",

Policy can be used to highlight power relationships, but it can also allow for depersonalization of power and decision-making: a leader could imply that while they don't really agree with a particular course of action, the policy dictates it and therefore it must be done. In the same way, policy can act as the source of authority such that hierarchy is unnecessary: a group of individuals may resort to policy to guide their decision-making when there is no established authority figure to set their direction. Ultimately, those who define policy exert power over those who follow policy and, in education at least, it is rare that policy is determined collectively: at best, leaders are elected democratically so they may set policy for the electorate. There is therefore an inevitable reliance on a political elite and a consequent hierarchy of power. A frequently seen example of policy as power in schools is uniform. It is for the 'governing board' of a school to determine if it has a uniform and, if so, what it is, but parents and children have a duty to comply, and school staff have a duty to enforce it. Countless children will have discovered that they cannot appeal to the logic that inadequate uniform does not affect their learning, nor can they resort to any individual to plead their case, for the power rests within the policy itself: it is sufficient to say that you have to wear school uniforms because that is what the policy says.",

Policy can be used to highlight power relationships, but it can also allow for depersonalization of power and decision-making: a leader could imply that while they don't really agree with a particular course of action, the policy dictates it and therefore it must (b) <u>do</u>. In the same way, policy can act as the source of authority such that hierarchy is unnecessary: a group of individuals may resort to policy to guide their decision-making when there is no established authority figure to set their direction. Ultimately, those who define policy (c) <u>exert</u> power over those who follow policy and, in education at least, it is rare that policy is determined collectively: at best, leaders are elected democratically so they may set policy for the electorate. There is therefore an inevitable reliance on a political elite and a consequent hierarchy of power. A frequently seen example of policy as power in schools is uniform. It is for the 'governing board' of a school to determine (d) <u>if</u> it has a uniform and, if so, what it is, but parents and children have a duty to comply, and school staff have a duty to enforce it. Countless children will have discovered that they cannot appeal to the logic that inadequate uniform does not affect their learning, nor can they resort to any individual to plead their case, for the power rests within the policy itself: it is sufficient to say that you have to wear school uniforms because (e) <u>what</u> is what the policy says.",

Riding them is a carefree experience — but it is more restrained than it might seem. <u>모든 여정은 시작부터 끝까지 추적된다</u>. No matter how hard the throttle is pressed, the scooters will not go above a particular speed. They refuse to leave designated urban areas. And there is no haggling over the fare: an app charges a precise sum depending on the length of the journey. None of this is inherently objectionable. But scooters do offer a helpful example of the paradox of digital technologies: they offer freedom, but only in exchange for some surrender of control. This is not a paradox that will ever be fully resolved. The question will always be whether the balance between freedom and control is struck in the right place.",

That notion, a linguistic Big Bang, has been championed by linguists such as Noam Chomsky. But it is extremely improbable, biologically speaking, that such a complex characteristic as our capacity for speech just popped up out of nowhere. It is more likely that language evolved in several stages in the same way, for instance, as our large brains did or our tool-making ability. This may have been a process similar to the one children go through, or the process may have been entirely different and involved intermediate forms. But some form of evolution must have occurred on the journey from non-speaking apes to speaking humans. At some point, there must have been linguistic precursors, simpler forms of language. There must also have been a protolanguage, the first one that could be called a language.",

Today, however, advances in information technology — specifically, computers and telecommunication — have resulted in a situation where information can be created by anyone and can flow from anyone to everyone else. Take, for example, these astounding statistics: at the time of writing this paper, the number of websites currently online is over 1.5 billion, the number of active users on some of the biggest social media platforms is over two billion, and the number of Internet users is over four billion. More specific to consumer-created content, 400 hours of videos are uploaded every minute, and searches of \"how to\" videos are growing 70% year over year on popular video sites. These numbers will likely increase by the time this manuscript goes to print. People today are not simply innocent consumers of information but also providers of information through their own content creation, which is \"the material people contribute to the online world.\" Today, the production and distribution of information is a market in which nearly everyone can, and does, participate.",

The cycle typically starts with a collection of incidental observations and the formulation of a possible explanation for these observations. This explanation is known as a theory. Based on this theory, we can then make predictions about conditions that we have not yet observed. In other words, we can formulate specific hypotheses. Now, we can design an experiment that aims to disprove our theory: when the results of our experiment are consistent with the theory, __________. When the results are inconsistent, however, we will either have to adjust our theory, or reject it altogether. It is impossible to 'prove' a theory: as long as we find no conflicting evidence, the theory remains plausible. This does not exclude the possibility, however, that there might be future results that will conflict. Although a theory becomes more plausible the more results we find that are consistent with it, it remains the case that (at least in principle) a single experiment yielding conflicting results would be sufficient to overthrow it.",

            "text": "One of the (a) <u>truths</u> about writing in science is that it substantially limits the amount of insincere blather that can emanate from the mind of a student when he/she has absolutely no idea about a correct response. A student who does not have a basic understanding of scientific theories will have immense difficulty (b) <u>in applying</u> them. In responding to an authentic scientific problem through an essay, there is no way to \"luck out\" on a guess at the correct answer; there is no place to hide. In general, essays that require students to invoke relevant scientific principles and theories and to explore potential applications are more genuine assessments of student knowledge than objective tests of short questions (c) <u>paired with</u> possible answers already furnished. (d) <u>The other</u> advantage of writing essays is that the teacher can get a sense of where student comprehension is strong and where understanding begins to break down. After all, writing is a form of concretized thought. Thus, when a student's grasp of a concept begins to get off-track, it is only through those moments when thought is made visible that a teacher is able to identify the problem and provide help. Writing provides the opportunity for the kind of intervention that can prevent conceptual misunderstandings that can haunt a student for their entire academic career. Indeed, Heddy \\& Sinatra (2013) and Francek (2013) have found that one of the most difficult areas of teaching is trying to get students (e) <u>unlearn</u> a misconception.",

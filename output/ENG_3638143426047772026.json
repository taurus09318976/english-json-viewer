With the emergence of 'identity politics', this has given rise to the recent phenomenon of fake news. Anything that doesn't conform to your tribe's views is rejected and labelled as fake news. It is not always falsified information, but it is often opinions that differ hugely from our own that are labelled fake news by politicians and the media alike. Jonathan Freedland in the Guardian terms it a new kind of cognitive bias called Tribal Epistemology, which is when the truth no longer corresponds to facts or evidence but rather when a specific assertion agrees with the viewpoint of the tribe or social group one belongs to. The boundaries between 'works for us' or 'good for us' and 'true' have blurred. Of course, this isn't a new phenomenon; we have been sorting ourselves into tribes since the beginning of human evolution. It has just been ignited by the recent political climate, media and technology, and by our tendency to believe in stories and narratives rather than facts. <u>Everyone loves a good story</u>.",

At least with dogs and cats we can sit down, observe, and interact with them, and they are happy for us to observe and interact. Real communication with our pets is not about teaching them human words ('sit', 'lie down', 'drop it'); real communication is about observing the animal in them. If you forget about any intention to train your dog to 'sit', what do you see when you spend time with him? Very much what you would see were you to spend time with a pack of wolves. Behaviours like expressing annoyance (perhaps just getting up and moving to another spot in the room) or expressing a desire for social interaction (licking your hand or lying next to you). These concepts are the true vocabulary of animals — not words and sentences — and the more you spend time with your animals, the more of <u>this true vocabulary</u> you will notice.",

This evening, the City of Calgary has issued a snowstorm alert and is encouraging residents to stay home. At TBS High School, we are also facing several concerns: students may not be able to walk to school safely, and many school buses will likely be delayed or, in some cases, canceled. With all of this in mind, we have made the decision to close our school on Tuesday, January 21. Students may either work on previously assigned tasks or spend time reviewing material previously covered at home. Thank you for your patience and understanding.\nSincerely,\nCaroline R. Robbins\nTBS High School Principal",

Therefore, we must know that credit must be given and shared. Apple's success wasn't exclusively Steve Jobs's, nor was Microsoft's success exclusively Bill Gates's.

With the emergence of 'identity politics', this has given rise to the recent phenomenon of fake news. Anything that doesn't conform to your tribe's views is rejected and labelled as fake news. It is not always falsified information, but it is often opinions that differ hugely from our own that are labelled fake news by politicians and the media alike. Jonathan Freedland in the Guardian terms it a new kind of cognitive bias called Tribal Epistemology, which is when the truth no longer corresponds to facts or evidence but rather when a specific assertion agrees with the viewpoint of the tribe or social group one belongs to. The boundaries between 'works for us' or 'good for us' and 'true' have blurred. Of course, this isn't a new phenomenon; we have been sorting ourselves into tribes since the beginning of human evolution. It has just been ignited by the recent political climate, media and technology, and by our tendency to believe in stories and narratives rather than facts. Everyone loves a good story.",

But in fact, ambiguity can be a productive, even positive state. When we conduct research, we try to encourage ourselves, our students, and our colleagues to enjoy a state of ambiguity. The logic is that when we don't know the answer, real knowledge can arise, so it is best to go slowly, think carefully, and enjoy the process of trying to find out what is going on. Sadly, this love of ambiguity is an uncommon mindset. Usually, we want quick and clear answers, especially when we are stressed. For some people, this antipathy to ambiguity contributes to their descent into misbelief. The ability not to rush to conclusions, to keep multiple hypotheses in mind, and to remain open to new information and possibilities is key to not getting sucked into misbelief. We tend to admire and seek out conviction and confidence. But we would be better served if we learned to admire and enjoy a state of ambiguity.",

Understanding machine learning can make an employee more likely to spot potential applications in their own work. Many of the most promising uses for machine learning will be humdrum, and this is where technology can be at its most useful: saving people time, so that they can concentrate on the many tasks at which they outperform machines. An executive assistant who has a better understanding of machine learning might suggest that calendar software learn more explicitly from patterns that develop over time, reminding them when their boss has not met with a team member for an unusually long time. A calendar that learns patterns could give an executive assistant more time for the human specialties of the job, such as helping their boss to manage a team.",

By telling stories using words, music and sound effects, radio can engage the imagination to communicate ideas and images that create a kind of narrative uniquely experienced by each individual listener. Through the omission of visual cues and by embracing the openness of the work, radio storytelling has the capacity to make personal connections, paint pictures with sound, and indeed create scenes that would be impossible in another context. The capacity of audio as a medium for imaginative and compelling storytelling is undiminished in the digital age, although the production, distribution and consumption cultures and technologies through which those stories are mediated have radically changed. In fact, the possibilities for radiophonic narrative are in many ways expanded in the digital age, as research engineers, professionals and enthusiasts explore the parameters of new production processes, platforms and interactive opportunities, as well as opportunities for radio storytelling to be taken outside the realm of the radio professional.",

Compared to a more controlled experimental laboratory environment, these environments offer both opportunities and constraints to measuring and understanding temperament traits. Farms are a source of large numbers of animals whose pedigree links with others on the farm and elsewhere are frequently known. Within any given farm, animals may also have experienced a fairly standardized rearing process. However, one farm differs from another in many respects, such as the quality of human interaction, the level of nutrition provided, and the social groups the animals are kept in, among others, all of which could affect temperament. For instance, to assess aggressiveness in individual pigs when groups of pigs are mixed with others, a test must be used in which all animals are mixed with a standardized number of unfamiliar animals, within a controlled weight range, and into pens of the same size. Such standardization can be achieved only on some farms. All of these factors mean that farms cannot be treated as statistical replicates, and each farm must be regarded as unique.",

            "text": "Storing and retrieving information is so key to survival that nature has evolved thousands of techniques to do so. For instance, Venus flytraps can count. To make sure that their traps don't get sprung with a single raindrop, they require three touches to a trap within a certain short period before they expend the energy needed to close. Thus, they must be able to count the touches as well as store the time interval between them. We actually know how this is done. When a trap is touched, some calcium is released by the plant, which slowly — over seconds — dissipates. Subsequent touches release more calcium, and if it hits a certain threshold, the trap snaps shut. Since the calcium is constantly dissipating, the sequential touches have to be within a certain time window to hit the threshold. This capability is clearly encoded in DNA somewhere, but again, information is being acted upon with hardly any cognition.",

Consider the hypothesis that 'all crows are black'. Even if one has seen a million black crows and never seen a crow of another colour, there is no guarantee that the next crow will be black. Even if one thinks one has seen every crow, one may be mistaken. Furthermore, one cannot see every future or past crow. Thus, no matter how many crows have been studied, even if all of them have been consistent with the hypothesis that all crows are black, there is no way to be certain, to prove, that all crows are black. Given the many crows I have seen and heard about, I am confident the great majority of crows are black, but I do not know for a fact that all crows are black.

            "text": "Dias \\& Ressler conducted an experiment with mice where they trained male mice to be afraid of the scent of cherry blossoms. Every time they introduced the smell of cherry blossoms, they would electrocute the mice. Three days later, they had the mice mate with female mice. The resultant pups were not electrocuted or introduced to the scent of cherry blossoms until adulthood. When they eventually introduced the offspring to the scent of cherry blossoms, the pups started shaking and displaying other symptoms of anxiety. These pups could also pick up subtle traces of cherry blossoms in the air, which changed the structure of their brains and certain areas lit up when monitored digitally. This same behaviour was observed in the following generation of the mice even though they had never been electrocuted. This led researchers to understand how we, as humans, carry our ancestors' emotional reactions to traumatic situations and events.",

Such information is more likely to involve an association of a target to a particular landmark than an association of a target to a particular viewer position. For example, a frequent location of one's keys may be on the chest of drawers near the door. However, the viewer probably does not have a habitual location relative to the chest, so obtaining the keys involves knowing the position of the keys relative to the chest as well as one's own position relative to that chest. Of course, in some cases, a person does have a habitual position relative to a landmark in a certain spatial context and that position is directly associated with the target object. For example, in a kitchen, the chef may have a habitual location relative to the stove, and the condiments may be in a specific location relative to that stove. In this context, ego-centered coding will be sufficient, and an inference about the relation of the condiments to the self via the stove will not be necessary.",

In challenging times, the most frequent response of enterprises to a recession is retrenchment of marketing investments in order to survive until the economy recovers.

The decision about the behavior of an autonomous car was made when a decision was made about its programming. This can be a lengthy process involving both the creation of appropriate legal regulations and their implementation by the manufacturer down to the individual programmer. Now, in addition to attempts to program machines to apply certain moral theories to particular situations, there are also those that aim to mimic human judgment as best as possible. This would not, however, lead to self-driving vehicles acquiring the status of \"moral agents.\" Their behavior would not be considered an action in the sense of a result of genuine decision-making. An autonomous vehicle merely implements the rules programmed into its software. This is also true when forms of self-learning Artificial Intelligence are used. Here, too, humans will select the training examples and decide what the correct answer is in each case. They decide what the program should \"learn\" and when it has \"learned\" enough.",

Some countries have official multiculturalism policies aimed at preserving the cultural identities of immigrant groups. In this context, multiculturalism advocates a society that extends fairness to distinct cultural and religious groups, with no one culture predominating. However, the term is more commonly used to describe a society consisting of minority immigrant cultures existing alongside a predominant, indigenous culture. Often, multiculturalism is interchangeably used with the term interculturalism. Which term is used depends on what language is spoken by the people. For example, English-speaking European researchers usually use the term multicultural, while non-English-speaking researchers use the term intercultural. It is also argued that multicultural describes the nature of the society whose members are from different ethnic and religious groups, while intercultural describes their interactions, negotiations, and processes. Another view is that intercultural refers to two culturally different groups of people, and multicultural refers to more than two culturally different groups of people. Therefore, the term multicultural is acceptable when referring to multiple cultures.",

If we want to understand what science is — the different ways knowledge has been produced both now and in the past, and how different peoples and cultures have come to hold the beliefs they have about the natural world — we simply have no choice but to look at history. To do this successfully, we need to overcome that modern condescension for the past that is often particularly prevalent in the history of science. Clearly, by the light of our current knowledge, most of what people in the past thought they knew was false. It is worth remembering, though, that by the same pessimistic induction, most of what we think we know now will turn out to be wrong by the future's standards.

Surprisingly, though, research findings related to this idea are mixed. A review of available evidence indicates that both reading and expressing emotions are related but only when individuals are trying to communicate their feelings to others. When these expressions occur spontaneously ― for instance, an expression of joy when something wonderful suddenly happens ― then being able to recognize others' facial expressions and displaying those cues clearly oneself are not related. To put it in other terms, people who express their emotions openly and easily are not necessarily accurate at recognizing the facial expressions of others. Accuracy appears to be tied to people's intentional focus on showing their own emotions in their facial expressions. Perhaps they gain greater insight into the nature of others' expressions by doing so, and this helps them to recognize others' underlying feelings more accurately.",

            "text": "If you look at mammals, the larger the animal, generally speaking, the longer its life span. This makes evolutionary sense. A small animal is more vulnerable to predators, and there would be no point in having a long life span if it is going to be eaten long before it dies of old age. But the more fundamental reason for the relationship between size and life span is that size is related to metabolic rate, which is roughly the rate at which an animal burns fuel in the form of food to provide the energy it needs to function. Small mammals have more surface area for their size and so lose heat more easily. To compensate, they need to generate more heat, which means maintaining a higher metabolic rate and eating more for their weight. This means that the total number of calories burned per hour by an animal increases more slowly than the mass of the animal. An animal that is ten times as large burns only four to five times as many calories per hour. So for their weight, smaller animals burn more calories than larger animals. The relationship between how fast an animal burns calories and its mass is named Kleiber's law after Max Kleiber, who showed in the 1930s that an animal's metabolic rate scales to the 3/4 power of its mass. The exact power is a matter of dispute and some show that for mammals, a 2/3 power fits the data better.",

This evening, the City of Calgary has issued a snowstorm alert and is encouraging residents to stay home. At TBS High School, we are also facing several concerns: students may not be able to walk to school safely, and many school buses will likely be delayed or, in some cases, canceled. With all of this in mind, we have made the decision to close our school on Tuesday, January 21. Students may either work on previously assigned tasks or spend time reviewing material previously covered at home. Thank you for your patience and understanding.\nSincerely,\nCaroline R. Robbins\nTBS High School Principal",

To make matters worse, they started dancing, too! My moment with the chapel was completely ruined by their inconsiderate behavior. Suddenly, some women in the group began motioning for me to join in. I attempted to decline by taking backward steps. Still, they just kept stretching their hands toward me. I looked down at my daughter, who looked back at me with curiosity. I shrugged and smiled. The next thing I knew, we were dancing together with huge smiles on our faces. As I squeezed my daughter's hand and did my best to keep time with the lively beat, my heart was filled with joy.

I've seen a number of entrepreneurs who built successful businesses and attributed all of their achievements to their own ingenuity. These people tend to lack the self-reflection and objectivity to see that their accomplishments likely would not have been possible without the assistance of various people and institutions external to themselves. It's all too easy to see failures in our lives as purely or predominantly due to outside (external) forces, and successes in our lives as purely or predominantly due to inside (internal) forces. Therefore, we must know that credit must be given and shared. Apple's success wasn't exclusively Steve Jobs's, nor was Microsoft's success exclusively Bill Gates's. Santa has thousands of little helpers who allow him to achieve the impossible. It takes a team of people (or elves) and a huge network for us to accomplish anything.",

With the emergence of 'identity politics', this has given rise to the recent phenomenon of fake news. Anything that doesn't conform to your tribe's views is rejected and labelled as fake news. It is not always falsified information, but it is often opinions that differ hugely from our own that are labelled fake news by politicians and the media alike. Jonathan Freedland in the Guardian terms it a new kind of cognitive bias called Tribal Epistemology, which is when the truth no longer corresponds to facts or evidence but rather when a specific assertion agrees with the viewpoint of the tribe or social group one belongs to. The boundaries between 'works for us' or 'good for us' and 'true' have blurred. Of course, this isn't a new phenomenon; we have been sorting ourselves into tribes since the beginning of human evolution. It has just been ignited by the recent political climate, media and technology, and by our tendency to believe in stories and narratives rather than facts. Everyone loves a good story.",

But in fact, ambiguity can be a productive, even positive state. When we conduct research, we try to encourage ourselves, our students, and our colleagues to enjoy a state of ambiguity. The logic is that when we don't know the answer, real knowledge can arise, so it is best to go slowly, think carefully, and enjoy the process of trying to find out what is going on. Sadly, this love of ambiguity is an uncommon mindset. Usually, we want quick and clear answers, especially when we are stressed. For some people, this antipathy to ambiguity contributes to their descent into misbelief. The ability not to rush to conclusions, to keep multiple hypotheses in mind, and to remain open to new information and possibilities is key to not getting sucked into misbelief. We tend to admire and seek out conviction and confidence. But we would be better served if we learned to admire and enjoy a state of ambiguity.",

But this misses a critical opportunity. For organizations to get the most that they can from Al , they should also be investing in helping all of their team members to understand the technology better. Understanding machine learning can make an employee more likely to spot potential applications in their own work. Many of the most promising uses for machine learning will be humdrum, and this is where technology can be at its most useful: saving people time, so that they can concentrate on the many tasks at which they outperform machines. An executive assistant who has a better understanding of machine learning might suggest that calendar software learn more explicitly from patterns that develop over time, reminding them when their boss has not met with a team member for an unusually long time. A calendar that learns patterns could give an executive assistant more time for the human specialties of the job, such as helping their boss to manage a team.",

By telling stories using words, music and sound effects, radio can engage the imagination to communicate ideas and images that create a kind of narrative uniquely experienced by each individual listener. Through the omission of visual cues and by embracing the openness of the work, radio storytelling has the capacity to make personal connections, paint pictures with sound, and indeed create scenes that would be impossible in another context. The capacity of audio as a medium for imaginative and compelling storytelling is undiminished in the digital age, although the production, distribution and consumption cultures and technologies through which those stories are mediated have radically changed. In fact, the possibilities for radiophonic narrative are in many ways expanded in the digital age, as research engineers, professionals and enthusiasts explore the parameters of new production processes, platforms and interactive opportunities, as well as opportunities for radio storytelling to be taken outside the realm of the radio professional.",

At age 67, Hillary was diagnosed with lung cancer, which required surgery to remove. The surgery resulted in a 25 percent reduction in her breathing ability, but she would not let this stop her. She became interested in the North Pole after visiting Canada and taking pictures of polar bears. In the spring of 2007, at the age of 75 , she became the oldest woman and the first African-American woman to ski to the North Pole. She reached the South Pole in 2011 at the age of 79, becoming the first African-American woman to reach both poles.",

Compared to a more controlled experimental laboratory environment, these environments offer both opportunities and constraints to measuring and understanding temperament traits. Farms are a source of large numbers of animals whose pedigree links with others on the farm and elsewhere are frequently known. Within any given farm, animals may also have experienced a fairly standardized rearing process. However, one farm differs from another in many respects, such as the quality of human interaction, the level of nutrition provided, and the social groups the animals are kept in, among others, all of which could affect temperament. For instance, to assess aggressiveness in individual pigs when groups of pigs are mixed with others, a test must be used in which all animals are mixed with a standardized number of unfamiliar animals, within a controlled weight range, and into pens of the same size. Such standardization can be achieved only on some farms. All of these factors mean that farms cannot be treated as statistical replicates, and each farm must be regarded as unique.",

To make sure that their traps don't get sprung with a single raindrop, they require three touches to a trap within a certain short period before they expend the energy needed to close. Thus, they must be able to count the touches as well as store the time interval between them. We actually know how this is done. When a trap is touched, some calcium is released by the plant, which slowly — over seconds — dissipates. Subsequent touches release more calcium, and if it hits a certain threshold, the trap snaps shut. Since the calcium is constantly dissipating, the sequential touches have to be within a certain time window to hit the threshold. This capability is clearly encoded in DNA somewhere, but again, information is being acted upon with hardly any cognition.",

Consider the hypothesis that 'all crows are black'. Even if one has seen a million black crows and never seen a crow of another colour, there is no guarantee that the next crow will be black. Even if one thinks one has seen every crow, one may be mistaken. Furthermore, one cannot see every future or past crow. Thus, no matter how many crows have been studied, even if all of them have been consistent with the hypothesis that all crows are black, there is no way to be certain, to prove, that all crows are black. Given the many crows I have seen and heard about, I am confident the great majority of crows are black, but I do not know for a fact that all crows are black. This is the inherent limitation of inductive reasoning.",

Real communication with our pets is not about teaching them human words ('sit', 'lie down', 'drop it'); real communication is about observing the animal in them. If you forget about any intention to train your dog to 'sit', what do you see when you spend time with him? Very much what you would see were you to spend time with a pack of wolves. Behaviours like expressing annoyance (perhaps just getting up and moving to another spot in the room) or expressing a desire for social interaction (licking your hand or lying next to you). These concepts are the true vocabulary of animals — not words and sentences — and the more you spend time with your animals, the more of this true vocabulary you will notice.",

The resultant pups were not electrocuted or introduced to the scent of cherry blossoms until adulthood. When they eventually introduced the offspring to the scent of cherry blossoms, the pups started shaking and displaying other symptoms of anxiety. These pups could also pick up subtle traces of cherry blossoms in the air, which changed the structure of their brains and certain areas lit up when monitored digitally. This same behaviour was observed in the following generation of the mice even though they had never been electrocuted.

Such information is more likely to involve an association of a target to a particular landmark than an association of a target to a particular viewer position. For example, a frequent location of one's keys may be on the chest of drawers near the door. However, the viewer probably does not have a habitual location relative to the chest, so obtaining the keys involves knowing the position of the keys relative to the chest as well as one's own position relative to that chest. Of course, in some cases, a person does have a habitual position relative to a landmark in a certain spatial context and that position is directly associated with the target object. For example, in a kitchen, the chef may have a habitual location relative to the stove, and the condiments may be in a specific location relative to that stove. In this context, ego-centered coding will be sufficient, and an inference about the relation of the condiments to the self via the stove will not be necessary.",

Therefore, they try to establish their advantage over their competitors by investing aggressively in marketing activities, research and development, and developing new products, whereas some enterprises cut their marketing expenditures and wait for the recession to pass. In challenging times, the most frequent response of enterprises to a recession is retrenchment of marketing investments in order to survive until the economy recovers. Reducing the marketing expenses such as advertising and communication may give short-term relief to the enterprise.

Now, in addition to attempts to program machines to apply certain moral theories to particular situations, there are also those that aim to mimic human judgment as best as possible. This would not, however, lead to self-driving vehicles acquiring the status of \"moral agents.\" Their behavior would not be considered an action in the sense of a result of genuine decision-making. An autonomous vehicle merely implements the rules programmed into its software. This is also true when forms of self-learning Artificial Intelligence are used. Here, too, humans will select the training examples and decide what the correct answer is in each case. They decide what the program should \"learn\" and when it has \"learned\" enough.",

            "text": "Multiculturalism is an ideology advocating that society should consist of, or at least allow and include, distinct cultural and religious groups, with fairness. Some countries have official multiculturalism policies aimed at preserving the cultural identities of immigrant groups. In this context, multiculturalism advocates a society that extends fairness to distinct cultural and religious groups, with no one culture predominating. However, the term is more commonly used to describe a society consisting of minority immigrant cultures existing alongside a predominant, indigenous culture. Often, multiculturalism is interchangeably used with the term interculturalism. Which term is used depends on what language is spoken by the people. For example, English-speaking European researchers usually use the term multicultural, while non-English-speaking researchers use the term intercultural. It is also argued that multicultural describes the nature of the society whose members are from different ethnic and religious groups, while intercultural describes their interactions, negotiations, and processes. Another view is that intercultural refers to two culturally different groups of people, and multicultural refers to more than two culturally different groups of people. Therefore, the term multicultural is acceptable when referring to multiple cultures.",

Science is certainly not a unified and continuous body of beliefs. Neither is it captured by a single scientific method. If we want to understand what science is — the different ways knowledge has been produced both now and in the past, and how different peoples and cultures have come to hold the beliefs they have about the natural world — we simply have no choice but to look at history. To do this successfully, we need to overcome that modern condescension for the past that is often particularly prevalent in the history of science. Clearly, by the light of our current knowledge, most of what people in the past thought they knew was false. It is worth remembering, though, that by the same pessimistic induction, most of what we think we know now will turn out to be wrong by the future's standards. The history of science should not be a game of rewarding winners and losers in the past.",

Surprisingly, though, research findings related to this idea are mixed. A review of available evidence indicates that both reading and expressing emotions are related but only when individuals are trying to communicate their feelings to others. When these expressions occur spontaneously - for instance, an expression of joy when something wonderful suddenly happens - then being able to recognize others' facial expressions and displaying those cues clearly oneself are not related. To put it in other terms, people who express their emotions openly and easily are not necessarily accurate at recognizing the facial expressions of others. Accuracy appears to be tied to people's intentional focus on showing their own emotions in their facial expressions. Perhaps they gain greater insight into the nature of others' expressions by doing so, and this helps them to recognize others' underlying feelings more accurately.",

            "text": "If you look at mammals, the larger the animal, generally speaking, the longer its life span. This makes evolutionary sense. A small animal is more vulnerable to predators, and there would be no point in having a long life span if it is going to be eaten long before it dies of old age. But the more fundamental reason for the relationship between size and life span is that size is related to metabolic rate, which is roughly the rate at which an animal burns fuel in the form of food to provide the energy it needs to function. Small mammals have more surface area for their size and so lose heat more easily. To compensate, they need to generate more heat, which means maintaining a higher metabolic rate and eating more for their weight. This means that the total number of calories burned per hour by an animal increases more slowly than the mass of the animal. An animal that is ten times as large burns only four to five times as many calories per hour. So for their weight, smaller animals burn more calories than larger animals. The relationship between how fast an animal burns calories and its mass is named Kleiber's law after Max Kleiber, who showed in the 1930s that an animal's metabolic rate scales to the 3/4 power of its mass. The exact power is a matter of dispute and some show that for mammals, a 2/3 power fits the data better.",

Thus, they must be able to count the touches as well as store the time interval between them. We actually know how this is done. When a trap is touched, some calcium is released by the plant, which slowly — over seconds — dissipates.

For example, a frequent location of one's keys may be on the chest of drawers near the door. However, the viewer probably does not have a habitual location relative to the chest, so obtaining the keys involves knowing the position of the keys relative to the chest as (B) <b>[ well / long ]</b> as one's own position relative to that chest. Of course, in some cases, a person does have a habitual position relative to a landmark in a certain spatial context and that position is directly associated with the target object. For example, in a kitchen, the chef may have a (C) <b>[ habitual / habitant ]</b> location relative to the stove, and the condiments may be in a specific location relative to that stove. In this context, ego-centered coding will be sufficient, and an inference about the relation of the condiments to the self via the stove will not be necessary.",

            "text": "If you look at mammals, the larger the animal, generally speaking, the longer its life span. This makes evolutionary sense. A small animal is more vulnerable to predators, and there would be no point in having a long life span if it is going to be eaten long before it dies of old age. But the more fundamental reason for the relationship between size and life span is that size is related to metabolic rate, which is roughly the rate (A) <b>[ at which / which ]</b> an animal burns fuel in the form of food to provide the energy it needs to function. Small mammals have more surface area for their size and so lose heat more easily. To compensate, they need to generate more heat, (B) <b>[ that / which ]</b> means maintaining a higher metabolic rate and eating more for their weight. This means that the total number of calories burned per hour by an animal (C) <b>[ increases / increase ]</b> more slowly than the mass of the animal. An animal that is ten times as large burns only four to five times as many calories per hour. So for their weight, smaller animals burn more calories than larger animals. The relationship between how fast an animal burns calories and its mass is named Kleiber's law after Max Kleiber, who showed in the 1930s that an animal's metabolic rate scales to the 3/4 power of its mass. The exact power is a matter of dispute and some show that for mammals, a 2/3 power fits the data better.",

This evening, the City of Calgary has issued a snowstorm alert and is encouraging residents to stay home. At TBS High School, __________: students may not be able to walk to school safely, and many school buses will likely be delayed or, in some cases, canceled. With all of this in mind, we have made the decision to close our school on Tuesday, January 21. Students may either work on previously assigned tasks or spend time reviewing material previously covered at home. Thank you for your patience and understanding.\nSincerely,\nCaroline R. Robbins\nTBS High School Principal",

(A) __________, I found a group of people singing loudly in the corner of the chapel. Why are these people ruining my trip? Do they even know what this place is? To make matters worse, they started dancing, too! My moment with the chapel was completely ruined by their inconsiderate behavior. Suddenly, some women in the group began motioning for me to join in. I attempted to decline by taking backward steps. (B) __________, they just kept stretching their hands toward me. I looked down at my daughter, who looked back at me with curiosity. I shrugged and smiled. The next thing I knew, we were dancing together with huge smiles on our faces. As I squeezed my daughter's hand and did my best to keep time with the lively beat, my heart was filled with joy. I knew that this would be my favorite memory of the trip.",

I've seen a number of entrepreneurs who built successful businesses and attributed all of their achievements to their own ingenuity. These people tend to lack the self-reflection and objectivity to see that their accomplishments likely would not have been possible without the assistance of various people and institutions external to themselves. It's all too easy to see failures in our lives as purely or predominantly due to outside (external) forces, and successes in our lives as purely or predominantly due to inside (internal) forces. Therefore, we must know that credit must be given and shared. Apple's success wasn't exclusively Steve Jobs's, nor was Microsoft's success exclusively Bill Gates's.

With the emergence of 'identity politics', this has given rise to the recent phenomenon of fake news. Anything that doesn't conform to your tribe's views is rejected and labelled as fake news. It is not always falsified information, but it is often opinions that differ hugely from our own that are labelled fake news by politicians and the media alike. Jonathan Freedland in the Guardian terms it a new kind of cognitive bias called Tribal Epistemology, which is when the truth no longer corresponds to facts or evidence but rather when a specific assertion agrees with the viewpoint of the tribe or social group one belongs to. The boundaries between 'works for us' or 'good for us' and 'true' have blurred. Of course, this isn't a new phenomenon; we have been sorting ourselves into tribes since the beginning of human evolution. It has just been ignited by the recent political climate, media and technology, and by our tendency to believe in stories and narratives rather than facts. Everyone loves a good story.",

But in fact, ambiguity can be a productive, even positive state. When we conduct research, we try to encourage ourselves, our students, and our colleagues to enjoy a state of ambiguity. The logic is that when we don't know the answer, real knowledge can arise, so it is best to go slowly, think carefully, and enjoy the process of trying to find out what is going on. Sadly, this love of ambiguity is an uncommon mindset. Usually, we want quick and clear answers, especially when we are stressed. For some people, this antipathy to ambiguity contributes to their descent into misbelief. The ability not to rush to conclusions, to keep multiple hypotheses in mind, and to remain open to new information and possibilities is key to not getting sucked into misbelief. We tend to admire and seek out conviction and confidence. But we would be better served if we learned to __________.",

An executive assistant who has a better understanding of machine learning might suggest that calendar software learn more explicitly from patterns that develop over time, reminding them when their boss has not met with a team member for an unusually long time.

To make sure that their traps don't get sprung with a single raindrop, they require three touches to a trap within a certain short period before they expend the energy needed to close. Thus, they must be able to count the touches as well as store the time interval between them. We actually know how this is done. When a trap is touched, some calcium is released by the plant, which slowly — over seconds — dissipates. Subsequent touches release more calcium, and if it hits a certain threshold, the trap snaps shut. Since __________. the sequential touches have to be within a certain time window to hit the threshold. This capability is clearly encoded in DNA somewhere, but again, information is being acted upon with hardly any cognition.",

To make sure that their traps don't get sprung with a single raindrop, they require three touches to a trap within a certain short period before they expend the energy needed to close. (B)__________, they must be able to count the touches as well as store the time interval between them. We actually know how this is done. When a trap is touched, some calcium is released by the plant, which slowly — over seconds — dissipates. Subsequent touches release more calcium, and if it hits a certain threshold, the trap snaps shut. Since the calcium is constantly dissipating, the sequential touches have to be within a certain time window to hit the threshold. This capability is clearly encoded in DNA somewhere, but again, information is being acted upon with hardly any cognition.",

Even if one thinks one has seen every crow, one may be mistaken. Furthermore, one cannot see every future or past crow. Thus, no matter how many crows have been studied, even if all of them have been consistent with the hypothesis that all crows are black, there is no way to be certain, to prove, that all crows are black.

Consider the hypothesis that 'all crows are black'. Even if one has seen a million black crows and never seen a crow of another colour, there is no guarantee that the next crow will be black. Even if one thinks one has seen every crow, one may be mistaken. (A)__________, one cannot see every future or past crow. (B)__________, no matter how many crows have been studied, even if all of them have been consistent with the hypothesis that all crows are black, there is no way to be certain, to prove, that all crows are black. Given the many crows I have seen and heard about, I am confident the great majority of crows are black, but I do not know for a fact that all crows are black. This is the inherent limitation of inductive reasoning.",

If you forget about any intention to train your dog to 'sit', what do you see when you spend time with him? Very much what you would see were you to spend time with a pack of wolves. Behaviours like expressing annoyance (perhaps just getting up and moving to another spot in the room) or expressing a desire for social interaction (licking your hand or lying next to you).

When they eventually introduced the offspring to the scent of cherry blossoms, the pups started shaking and displaying other symptoms of anxiety. These pups could also pick up subtle traces of cherry blossoms in the air, which changed the structure of their brains and certain areas lit up when monitored digitally.

Science is certainly not a unified and continuous body of beliefs. Neither is it captured by a single scientific method. If we want to understand what science is — the different ways knowledge has been produced both now and in the past, and how different peoples and cultures have come to hold the beliefs they have about the natural world — we simply have no choice but to look at history. To do this successfully, we need to overcome that modern condescension for the past that is often particularly prevalent in the history of science. Clearly, by the light of our current knowledge, most of what people in the past thought they knew was false. It is worth remembering, though, that by the same pessimistic induction, most of what we think we know now will turn out to be wrong by the future's standards. The history of science should not be a game of rewarding winners and losers in the past.",

            "text": "If you look at mammals, the larger the animal, generally speaking, the longer its life span. This __________. A small animal is more vulnerable to predators, and there would be no point in having a long life span if it is going to be eaten long before it dies of old age. But the more fundamental reason for the relationship between size and life span is that size is related to metabolic rate, which is roughly the rate at which an animal burns fuel in the form of food to provide the energy it needs to function. Small mammals have more surface area for their size and so lose heat more easily. To compensate, they need to generate more heat, which means maintaining a higher metabolic rate and eating more for their weight. This means that the total number of calories burned per hour by an animal increases more slowly than the mass of the animal. An animal that is ten times as large burns only four to five times as many calories per hour. So for their weight, smaller animals burn more calories than larger animals. The relationship between how fast an animal burns calories and its mass is named Kleiber's law after Max Kleiber, who showed in the 1930s that an animal's metabolic rate scales to the 3/4 power of its mass. The exact power is a matter of dispute and some show that for mammals, a 2/3 power fits the data better.",

A small animal is more vulnerable to predators, and there would be no point in having a long life span if it is going to be eaten long before it dies of old age. But the more fundamental reason for the relationship between size and life span is that size is related to metabolic rate, which is roughly the rate at which an animal burns fuel in the form of food to provide the energy it needs to function. (①) Small mammals have more surface area for their size and so lose heat more easily. (②) This means that the total number of calories burned per hour by an animal increases more slowly than the mass of the animal. (③) An animal that is ten times as large burns only four to five times as many calories per hour. (④) So for their weight, smaller animals burn more calories than larger animals. (⑤) The relationship between how fast an animal burns calories and its mass is named Kleiber&apos;s law after Max Kleiber, who showed in the 1930s that an animal&apos;s metabolic rate scales to the 3/4 power of its mass. The exact power is a matter of dispute and some show that for mammals, a 2/3 power fits the data better.</span></div>",

This evening, the City of Calgary has issued a snowstorm alert and is encouraging residents to stay home. At TBS High School, we are also facing several concerns: students may not be able to walk to school safely, and many school buses will likely be delayed or, in some cases, canceled. With all of this in mind, we have made the decision to close our school on Tuesday, January 21. Students may either work on previously assigned tasks or spend time reviewing material previously covered at home. Thank you for your patience and understanding.\nSincerely,\nCaroline R. Robbins\nTBS High School Principal",

To make matters worse, they started dancing, too! My moment with the chapel was completely ruined by their inconsiderate behavior. Suddenly, some women in the group began motioning for me to join in. I attempted to decline by taking backward steps. Still, they just kept stretching their hands toward me. I looked down __________. I shrugged and smiled.

With the emergence of 'identity politics', this has given rise to the recent phenomenon of fake news. Anything that doesn't conform to your tribe's views is rejected and labelled as fake news. It is not always falsified information, but it is often opinions that differ hugely from our own that are labelled fake news by politicians and the media alike. Jonathan Freedland in the Guardian terms it a new kind of cognitive bias called Tribal Epistemology, which is when the truth no longer corresponds to facts or evidence but rather when a specific assertion agrees with the viewpoint of the tribe or social group one belongs to. The boundaries between 'works for us' or 'good for us' and 'true' have blurred. Of course, this isn't a new phenomenon; we have been sorting ourselves into tribes since the beginning of human evolution. It has just been ignited by the recent political climate, media and technology, and by our tendency to believe in stories and narratives rather than facts. Everyone loves a good story.",

But in fact, ambiguity can be a productive, even positive state. When we conduct research, we try to encourage (b) <u>us</u>, our students, and our colleagues to enjoy a state of ambiguity. The logic is that when we don't know the answer, real knowledge can arise, so it is best to go slowly, think carefully, and enjoy the process of trying to find out what is going on. Sadly, this love of ambiguity is an uncommon mindset. Usually, we want quick and clear answers, especially when we are stressed.

But in fact, ambiguity can be a productive, even positive state. When we conduct research, we try to encourage ourselves, our students, and our colleagues to enjoy a state of ambiguity. The logic is that when we don't know the answer, real knowledge can arise, so it is best to go slowly, think carefully, and enjoy the process of trying to find out what is going on. Sadly, this love of ambiguity is an uncommon mindset. Usually, we want quick and clear answers, especially when we are stressed.

For organizations to get the most that they can from Al , they should also be investing in helping all of their team members to understand the technology better. Understanding machine learning can make an employee more likely to spot potential applications in their own work. Many of the most promising uses for machine learning will be humdrum, and this is where technology can be at its most useful: saving people time, so that they can concentrate on the many tasks at which they outperform machines. An executive assistant who has a better understanding of machine learning might suggest that calendar software learn more explicitly from patterns that develop over time, reminding them when their boss has not met with a team member for an unusually long time. A calendar that learns patterns could give an executive assistant more time for the human specialties of the job, such as helping their boss to manage a team.",

But this misses a critical opportunity. For organizations to get the most that they can from Al , they should also be investing in helping all of their team members to understand the technology better. Understanding machine learning can make an employee more likely to spot potential applications in their own work. Many of the most promising uses for machine learning will be humdrum, and this is where technology can be at its most useful: saving people time, so that they can concentrate on the many tasks at which they outperform machines. An executive assistant who has a better understanding of machine learning might suggest that calendar software learn more explicitly from patterns that develop over time, reminding them when their boss has not met with a team member for an unusually long time. A calendar that learns patterns could give an executive assistant more time for the human specialties of the job, such as helping their boss to manage a team.",

By telling stories using words, music and sound effects, radio can engage the imagination to communicate ideas and images that create a kind of narrative uniquely experienced by each individual listener. Through the omission of visual cues and by embracing the openness of the work, radio storytelling has the capacity to make personal connections, paint pictures with sound, and indeed create scenes that would be impossible in another context. The capacity of audio as a medium for imaginative and compelling storytelling is undiminished in the digital age, although the production, distribution and consumption cultures and technologies through which those stories are mediated have radically changed. In fact, the possibilities for radiophonic narrative are in many ways expanded in the digital age, as research engineers, professionals and enthusiasts explore the parameters of new production processes, platforms and interactive opportunities, as well as opportunities for radio storytelling to be taken outside the realm of the radio professional.",

Compared to a more controlled experimental laboratory environment, these environments offer both opportunities and constraints to measuring and understanding temperament traits. Farms are a source of large numbers of animals whose pedigree links with others on the farm and elsewhere are frequently known. Within any given farm, animals may also have experienced a fairly standardized rearing process. However, one farm differs from another in many respects, such as the quality of human interaction, the level of nutrition provided, and the social groups the animals are kept in, among others, all of which could affect temperament. For instance, to assess aggressiveness in individual pigs when groups of pigs are mixed with others, a test must be used in which all animals are mixed with a standardized number of unfamiliar animals, within a controlled weight range, and into pens of the same size. Such standardization can be achieved only on some farms. All of these factors mean that farms cannot be treated as statistical replicates, and each farm must be regarded as unique.",

            "text": "For livestock, researchers are typically measuring temperament traits in groups of animals on experimental or commercial farms. Compared to a more controlled experimental laboratory environment, these environments offer both opportunities and constraints to measuring and understanding temperament traits. Farms are a source of large numbers of animals whose pedigree links with others on the farm and elsewhere are frequently known. Within any given farm, animals may also have experienced a fairly standardized rearing process. However, one farm differs from another in many respects, such as the quality of human interaction, the level of nutrition provided, and the social groups the animals are kept in, among others, all of which could affect temperament. For instance, to assess aggressiveness in individual pigs when groups of pigs are mixed with others, a test must be used in which all animals are mixed with a standardized number of unfamiliar animals, within a controlled weight range, and into pens of the same size. Such standardization can be achieved only on some farms. All of these factors mean that farms cannot be treated as statistical replicates, and <u>각 농장은 고유한 것으로 간주되어야 한다</u>.",

To make sure that their traps don't get sprung with a single raindrop, they require three touches to a trap within a certain short period before they expend the energy needed to close. Thus, they must be able to count the touches as well as store the time interval between them. We actually know how this is done. When a trap is touched, some calcium is released by the plant, which slowly — over seconds — dissipates. Subsequent touches release more calcium, and if it hits a certain threshold, the trap snaps shut. Since the calcium is constantly dissipating, the sequential touches have to be within a certain time window to hit the threshold. This capability is clearly encoded in DNA somewhere, but again, information is being acted upon with hardly any cognition.",

            "text": "Dias & Ressler conducted an experiment with mice where they trained male mice to be afraid of the scent of cherry blossoms. Every time they introduced the smell of cherry blossoms, they would electrocute the mice. Three days later, they had the mice mate with female mice. The resultant pups were not electrocuted or introduced to the scent of cherry blossoms until adulthood. When they eventually introduced the offspring to the scent of cherry blossoms, the pups started shaking and displaying other symptoms of anxiety. These pups could also pick up subtle traces of cherry blossoms in the air, which changed the structure of their brains and certain areas lit up when monitored digitally. This same behaviour was observed in the following generation of the mice even though they had never been electrocuted. This led researchers to understand how we, as humans, carry our ancestors' emotional reactions to traumatic situations and events.",

Such information is more likely to involve an association of a target to a particular landmark than an association of a target to a particular viewer position. For example, a frequent location of one's keys may be on the chest of drawers near the door. However, the viewer probably does not have a habitual location relative to the chest, so obtaining the keys involves knowing the position of the keys relative to the chest as well as one's own position relative to that chest. Of course, in some cases, a person does have a habitual position relative to a landmark in a certain spatial context and that position is directly associated with the target object. For example, in a kitchen, the chef may have a habitual location relative to the stove, and the condiments may be in a specific location relative to that stove. In this context, ego-centered coding will be sufficient, and an inference about the relation of the condiments to the self via the stove will not be necessary.",

Some enterprises view tough times as an opportunity to strengthen their businesses. Therefore, they try to establish their advantage over their competitors by investing aggressively in marketing activities, research and development, and developing new products, whereas some enterprises cut their marketing expenditures and wait for the recession to pass. In challenging times, the most frequent response of enterprises to a recession is retrenchment of marketing investments in order to survive until the economy recovers. Reducing the marketing expenses such as advertising and communication may give short-term relief to the enterprise. However, in the long run, enterprises may risk losing their customer base and market share.",

The decision about the behavior of an autonomous car was made when a decision was made about its programming. This can be a lengthy process involving both the creation of appropriate legal regulations and their implementation by the manufacturer down to the individual programmer. Now, in addition to attempts to program machines to apply certain moral theories to particular situations, there are also those that aim to mimic human judgment as best as possible. This would not, however, lead to self-driving vehicles acquiring the status of \"moral agents.\" Their behavior would not be considered an action in the sense of a result of genuine decision-making. An autonomous vehicle merely implements the rules programmed into its software. This is also true when forms of self-learning Artificial Intelligence are used. Here, too, humans will select the training examples and decide what the correct answer is in each case. They decide what the program should \"learn\" and when it has \"learned\" enough.",

The decision about the behavior of an autonomous car was made when a decision was made about its programming. This can be a lengthy process involving both the creation of appropriate legal regulations and their implementation by the manufacturer down to the individual programmer. Now, in addition to attempts to program machines to apply certain moral theories to particular situations, there are also those that aim to mimic human judgment as best as possible. This would not, however, lead to self-driving vehicles acquiring the status of \"moral agents.\" Their behavior would not be considered an action in the sense of a result of genuine decision-making. An autonomous vehicle merely implements the rules programmed into its software. This is also true when forms of self-learning Artificial Intelligence are used. Here, too, __________. They decide what the program should \"learn\" and when it has \"learned\" enough.",

Some countries have official multiculturalism policies aimed at preserving the cultural identities of immigrant groups. In this context, multiculturalism advocates a society that extends fairness to distinct cultural and religious groups, with no one culture predominating. However, the term is more commonly used to describe a society consisting of minority immigrant cultures existing alongside a predominant, indigenous culture. Often, multiculturalism is interchangeably used with the term interculturalism. Which term is used depends on what language is spoken by the people. For example, English-speaking European researchers usually use the term multicultural, while non-English-speaking researchers use the term intercultural. It is also argued that multicultural describes the nature of the society whose members are from different ethnic and religious groups, while intercultural describes their interactions, negotiations, and processes. Another view is that intercultural refers to two culturally different groups of people, and multicultural refers to more than two culturally different groups of people. Therefore, the term multicultural is acceptable when referring to multiple cultures.",

            "text": "Multiculturalism is an ideology advocating that society should (a) <u>consist</u>, or at least allow and include, distinct cultural and religious groups, with fairness. Some countries have official multiculturalism policies aimed at preserving the cultural identities of immigrant groups. In this context, multiculturalism advocates a society that extends fairness to distinct cultural and religious groups, with no one culture predominating. However, the term is more commonly used to describe a society consisting of minority immigrant cultures existing alongside a predominant, indigenous culture. Often, multiculturalism is interchangeably used with the term interculturalism. Which term (b) <u>is used</u> depends on what language is spoken by the people. For example, English-speaking European researchers usually use the term multicultural, while non-English-speaking researchers use the term intercultural. It is also argued that multicultural describes the nature of the society whose members are from different ethnic and religious groups, (c) <u>while</u> intercultural describes their interactions, negotiations, and processes. (d) <u>Another</u> view is that intercultural refers to two culturally different groups of people, and multicultural refers to more than two culturally different groups of people. Therefore, the term multicultural is acceptable when (e) <u>refer</u> to multiple cultures. ",

Surprisingly, though, research findings related to this idea are mixed. A review of available evidence indicates that both reading and expressing emotions are related but only when individuals are trying to communicate their feelings to others. When these expressions occur spontaneously — for instance, an expression of joy when something wonderful suddenly happens — then being able to recognize others' facial expressions and displaying those cues clearly oneself are not related. To put it in other terms, people who express their emotions openly and easily are not necessarily accurate at recognizing the facial expressions of others. Accuracy appears to be tied to people's intentional focus on showing their own emotions in their facial expressions. Perhaps they gain greater insight into the nature of others' expressions by doing so, and this helps them to recognize others' underlying feelings more accurately.",

Surprisingly, though, research findings related to this idea are mixed. A review of available evidence indicates that both reading and expressing emotions are related but only when individuals are trying to communicate their feelings to others. When these expressions occur spontaneously — for instance, an expression of joy when something wonderful suddenly happens — then being able to recognize others' facial expressions and displaying those cues clearly oneself are not related. To put it in other terms, people who express their emotions openly and easily are not necessarily accurate at recognizing the facial expressions of others. Accuracy appears to be tied to people's intentional focus on showing their own emotions in their facial expressions. Perhaps they gain greater insight into the nature of others' expressions by doing so, and this helps them to recognize others' underlying feelings more accurately.",

            "text": "If you look at mammals, the larger the animal, generally speaking, the longer its life span. This makes evolutionary sense. A small animal is more vulnerable to predators, and there would be no point in having a long life span if it is going to be eaten long before it dies of old age. But the more fundamental reason for the relationship between size and life span is that size is related to metabolic rate, which is roughly the rate at which an animal burns fuel in the form of food to provide the energy it needs to function. Small mammals have more surface area for their size and so lose heat more easily. To compensate, they need to generate more heat, which means maintaining a higher metabolic rate and eating more for their weight. This means that the total number of calories burned per hour by an animal increases more slowly than the mass of the animal. An animal that is ten times as large burns only four to five times as many calories per hour. So for their weight, smaller animals burn more calories than larger animals. The relationship between how fast an animal burns calories and its mass is named Kleiber's law after Max Kleiber, who showed in the 1930s that an animal's metabolic rate scales to the 3/4 power of its mass. The exact power is a matter of dispute and some show that for mammals, a 2/3 power fits the data better.",

            "text": "If you look at mammals, the larger the animal, generally speaking, the longer its life span. This makes evolutionary sense. A small animal is more vulnerable to predators, and there would be no point in having a long life span if it is going to be eaten long before it dies of old age. But the more fundamental reason for the relationship between size and life span is that size is related to metabolic rate, (a) <u>which</u> is roughly the rate at which an animal burns fuel in the form of food to provide the energy it needs to function. Small mammals have more surface area for their size and so lose heat more easily. To compensate, they need to generate more heat, which means maintaining a higher metabolic rate and eating more for their weight. This means that the total number of calories burned per hour by an animal increases more slowly than the mass of the animal. An animal that is ten times as large burns only four to five times as (b) <u>many</u> calories per hour. So for their weight, smaller animals burn more calories than larger animals. The relationship between how fast an animal burns calories and its mass (c) <u>are</u> named Kleiber's law after Max Kleiber, (d) <u>that</u> showed in the 1930s that an animal's metabolic rate scales to the 3/4 power of its mass. The exact power is a matter of dispute and some show that for mammals, a 2/3 power (e) <u>fits</u> the data better.",

The study showed that office workers who habitually stopped what they were doing to respond to emails and texts ② <u>be</u> in a similar mental state to someone who had not slept the night before. Of the 1,100 study subjects, over half said they immediately responded to all emails, and the study confirmed that this kind of continual disruption in the workplace can drastically affect employees. The researchers even reported that workers ③ <u>show</u> to suffer a temporary IQ drop of roughly 10 points when they were repeatedly interrupted by phone calls and emails. There is no question that, when used appropriately, communication devices and services can boost productivity. However, when their use is not controlled, they may compromise workers' mental states and therefore also their performance.",

It was also meant to develop their appreciation of the arts, such as music, poetry, and drama. The people of ancient Greece held clear ideas about the character and ideals that a truly noble person should have, and the daily activities of life were intended to help citizens become such a person. Improving children's physical, mental, and social well-being through play was seen as an important step in this process. Nowadays, most societies aren't this demanding, but the influence of the Greeks can still be seen in modern views of recreation and leisure.",

In many ways, this is already happening, but some analog products have made a comeback recently.

Surprisingly, a lot of these sales are driven by millennials who aren't attached to these items by nostalgia. <u>그들이 아날로그 제품들을 선택하는 것이 이상하게 보일지도 모른다</u> over more modern and efficient technology. But efficiency isn't always the primary goal for humans. We are emotional beings who also value the slower, hands-on experiences that analog products provide.

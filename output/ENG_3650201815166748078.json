The collection of pictures, tools, and historical documents made the gold miners arriving to Qukkon come to life. This reminded me of when I lived in Qukkon and worked in the mining industry. Because of this, I'm wondering if there are volunteer guide positions available for this exhibition. I can share my experiences working in the extreme cold of Qukkon. Again, I would be thankful if you could tell me about the availability of volunteer positions as a guide.",

It also is the basis for several major industries found in many countries around the world such as in agriculture, food processing, food retailing and food service. For millennia, the focus of those involved with food as a human and economic phenomenon was on its production, preservation, distribution, pricing and other practical concerns. But in the late 18th century this began to change. Food became more than just a life necessity. Restaurants began to be developed, initially in France but eventually in other nations, as a distinct institution offering people dining choices and table service, the opportunity for __________ and, over time, a finer and finer atmosphere. The rise of restaurants eventually led to a class of diners who prided themselves on being critics of taste, food and cooking. Brillat-Savarin is probably the best known of the 'culinary philosophers' or, in today's parlance, a 'foodie'.",

In 1954, she graduated from the University of California at Berkeley with a master's degree in zoology. Then she earned her doctorate degree in science education from Stanford University in 1964. Through her research, Rowe discovered that learning could be improved by increasing teachers' average \"wait time\" for students' responses. During her career,she directed a science education program in Harlem. She also served as President of the National Science Teachers Association. In 1990, she published her book, The Process of Knowing. Throughout her career, she practiced Einstein's advice, \"Science is exploring, and exploring is fun.\" ( <u>그녀가 1996년에 사망했을 때, 그녀는 과학 교육계의 선도적인 인물 중 한 명으로 기억되었다</u> ).",

Most characters are supposed to be types with whom we are familiar. Such closeness and familiarity make it easier for us to perceive the imaginary story to be a real one. In other circumstances, such as when violence is shown on TV, the closeness variable is used to reduce emotional intensity. Television entertainment tends to place social problems involving violence in another time and place, letting us watch those fictionalized characters search for solutions to our problems in settings safely distanced from our own. When violence occurs in a contemporary setting, it is generally the product of the interaction of police and criminals - again, it is removed from the lives of good citizenry.",

            "text": "If we take an evolutionary look at our beginnings, we see a life in which high levels of physical activity were required for survival. Even one century ago, most people needed to be physically active to work, to travel, and to take care of homes and families. Our modern world has engineered such activity out of our lives. There are fewer manual jobs, we do not need to travel on foot, we do not need to hunt and harvest for our food, and many domestic chores have been mechanized. [ <u>many problems / while / create / benefits / our longevity / quality of life / also / create / they / and / for / many / these changes</u> ]. Lack of sufficient physical activity has now been linked to at least 17 unhealthy conditions, almost all of which are chronic diseases or considered risk factors for chronic diseases. Adrianne Hardman has summarized this serious situation for public health: \"Physical inactivity is a waste of human potential for health and well-being.\"",

In fact, the pattern of its movement is __________. No matter how much care is taken to start the pendulum in the same position, it will visit an entirely different set of points on the two occasions. Chaotic systems are generated by iteration, though not all iteration leads to chaos. In order to produce chaos, the iteration has to be within what is called a nonlinear system.

You felt weak in comparison, when in fact, objectively, you put in a very strong performance. Environmental factors may be involved. Perhaps you mastered your day's objective due to especially favorable conditions, such as low humidity, when in fact, you really didn't climb particularly well.

They achieve this by pinpointing their target audience, crafting a unique value proposition, and shaping a recognizable identity. While scholars might initially find these entrepreneurial concepts alien, they actually engage in similar practices when they set themselves apart in their academic writing. Consider the typical literature review and motivation section of a scholarly article — the aim is to highlight gaps in existing research and position oneself as the one who will address these overlooked areas. The challenge, as Labaree suggests, is not just in developing innovative ideas but in cultivating a distinctive voice that makes readers think, \"Ah, this sounds like [the author].\"",

Much of the emphasis in a discussion is on getting students involved in thinking, reacting, and responding. These are important intellectual activities in the learning process, for through them you are supposed to discover and express your opinions. Writing is an invaluable tool for accomplishing these tasks. Unfortunately, too many times, when class discussion begins, pens and pencils go down. Admittedly, it is considerably more difficult to take notes from discussions than from lectures, for, unlike lectures, discussions tend to be disorganized and difficult to follow. Also, <u>학생들은 보통 다른 학생이 하는 말 중 얼마나 많은 부분이 중요한지 모른다</u>. And if you are an active participant, it is not easy to take notes and formulate what you want to say.

Nonetheless, there has been a movement within the animal cognition community to say that animals can, in fact, teach one another. For example, skilled ants engage in a behavior called tandem running, in which they touch their bodies to the body of a novice ant as they lay down chemical trails, presumably to assist the newcomer with route learning. Killer whales also repeat the same seal hunting technique in front of their offspring, sometimes without even killing the seal, leading researchers to ask why they would repeatedly catch and release a seal if they were not planning to eat it. Considering the amount of energy they'd have to expend, there would need to be a good reason, and that reason might be teaching.",

Of Esch, the most important character in Hermann Broch's masterpiece The Sleepwalkers, we learn only that he has big teeth. Even so, we don't feel as if his face is a dentate blankness. Most often, we mistake being told what effect someone's appearance has for an account of that appearance. The poet Mallarmé's advice — Peindre non la chose, mais l'effet qu'elle produit ('Paint not the thing itself but the effect it produces') sounds like a self-denying ordinance. Actually it is a rather clever way out of an intractable problem. When, in one of his novels, Evelyn Waugh says of a new character, that 'he had just the kind of appearance one would expect a young man of his type to have' and nothing else, you still feel as if you have been told exactly what he looks like.",

In fact, the pattern of its movement is chaotic. No matter how much care is taken to start the pendulum in the same position, it will visit an entirely different set of points on the two occasions. Chaotic systems are generated by (C)__________, though not all iteration leads to chaos. In order to produce chaos, the iteration has to be within what is called a(an) (D)__________ system. Nor are all nonlinear systems chaotic: to become so they need to be (E)__________ beyond a certain point, called a bifurcation.",

These are important intellectual activities in the learning process, for through them you are supposed to discover and (A) <b>[ express / conceal ]</b> your opinions. Writing is an invaluable tool for accomplishing these tasks. Unfortunately, too many times, when class discussion begins, pens and pencils go down. Admittedly, it is considerably more difficult to take notes from discussions than from lectures, for, unlike lectures, discussions tend to be (B) <b>[ organized / disorganized ]</b> and difficult to follow. Also, students usually don't know how much of what other students are saying is important. And if you are an active participant, it is not easy to take notes and formulate what you want to say. But note taking in discussions is not only (C) <b>[ manageable / unavailable ]</b>, it is also important. Note taking helps to keep you active and alert.",

Most often, we mistake being told what effect someone's (B)__________ has for an account of that appearance. The poet Mallarmé's advice - Peindre non la chose, mais l'effet qu'elle produit ('Paint not the thing itself but the effect it produces') sounds like a(an) (C)__________. Actually it is a rather clever way out of an intractable problem. When, in one of his novels, Evelyn Waugh says of a new character, that 'he had just the kind of appearance one would expect a young man of his type to have' and nothing else, you still feel as if you have been told exactly what he looks like.",

In 1954, she graduated from the University of California at Berkeley with a master's degree in zoology. Then she earned her doctorate degree in science education from Stanford University in 1964. Through her research, Rowe discovered that learning could be improved by increasing teachers' average \"wait time\" for students' responses. During her career, she directed a science education program in Harlem. She also served as President of the National Science Teachers Association. In 1990, she published her book, The Process of Knowing. Throughout her career, she practiced Einstein's advice, \"Science is exploring, and exploring is fun.\"",

Even one century ago, most people needed to be physically active to work, to travel, and to take care of homes and families. Our modern world has engineered such activity out of our lives. There are fewer manual jobs, we do not need to travel on foot, we do not need to hunt and harvest for our food, and many domestic chores have been mechanized. While these changes have created many benefits for our longevity and quality of life, they have also created many problems. Lack of sufficient physical activity has now been linked to at least 17 unhealthy conditions, almost all of which are chronic diseases or considered risk factors for chronic diseases. Adrianne Hardman has summarized this serious situation for public health: \"__________ is a waste of human potential for health and well-being.\"",

            "text": "A good example of chaos is the magnetic pendulum sold as an executive toy. It has four magnets arranged in a square at the base and a pendulum that swings back and forth between them. Release the pendulum and note the magnets that it visits, and in what order. If the pendulum is released from the same position a second time, the pattern of movement may at first be the same but soon it will become completely different. In fact, the pattern of its movement is chaotic. No matter how much care is taken to start the pendulum in the same position, it will visit an entirely different set of points on the two occasions. Chaotic systems are generated by iteration, though not all iteration leads to chaos. In order to produce chaos, the iteration has to be within what is called a nonlinear system. Nor are all nonlinear systems chaotic: to become so they need to be pushed beyond a certain point, called a bifurcation. <u>그 지점에 도달되기 전까지 그것들은 꽤 질서정연한 방식으로 움직일 수도 있다</u>.",

Today, the world of work is the main way that we share out the fruits of growth: for most people, their job is their main, if not their only, source of income. Technological unemployment would weaken that longstanding arrangement, encouraging an even more extreme version of __________ in which some people receive more income than others and many receive nothing at all. Nor would the disturbance be only economic. For many people, their work is both a source of income and of meaning. And with that in mind, the threat is even broader: not only that the labor market might be hollowed out, leaving some unable to find a good job and a reliable income, but that this sense of fulfillment that some people are fortunate to feel in their jobs might be hollowed out as well.",

It also is the basis for several major industries found in many countries around the world such as in agriculture, food processing, food retailing and food service. For millennia, the focus of those involved with food as a human and economic phenomenon was on its production, preservation, distribution, pricing and other practical concerns. But in the late 18th century this began to change. Food became more than just a life necessity. Restaurants began to be developed, initially in France but eventually in other nations, as a distinct institution offering people dining choices and table service, the opportunity for socialization and, over time, a finer and finer atmosphere.

In other circumstances, such as when violence is shown on TV, the closeness variable is used to reduce __________ Television entertainment tends to place social problems involving violence in another time and place, letting us watch those fictionalized characters search for solutions to our problems in settings safely distanced from our own. When violence occurs in a contemporary setting, it is generally the product of the interaction of police and criminals - again, it is removed from the lives of good citizenry.",

Entrepreneurs understand the importance of building a brand that makes them memorable and distinct from their competitors, drawing customers to their products or services. They achieve this by pinpointing their target audience, crafting a unique value proposition, and shaping a recognizable identity. While scholars might initially find these entrepreneurial concepts alien, they actually engage in similar practices when they set themselves apart in their academic writing. Consider the typical literature review and motivation section of a scholarly article - the aim is to highlight gaps in existing research and position oneself as the one who will __________. The challenge, as Labaree suggests, is not just in developing innovative ideas but in cultivating a distinctive voice that makes readers think, \"Ah, this sounds like [the author].\"",

One evening, he noticed that two chimpanzees had been left outside their shelter during a heavy rainstorm. After approaching them and unlocking the shelter door, he stepped to the side, expecting them to enter the shelter as quickly as possible. However, before doing so, they (b) <b>[ ceased / paused ]</b> to hug Köhler, one around his legs and the other around his chest, despite the rain that continued to pour down. It was only after expressing their gratitude in this way that they went inside. (c) <b>[ Similar / Dissimilar ]</b> behavior was observed by the famous researcher Jane Goodall after she rescued a chimpanzee that was near death and cared for it until it recovered. When the chimpanzee was brought back to the jungle, it warmly embraced Goodall before departing.",

An early observation of this phenomenon was made by Wolfgang Köhler, a psychologist who spent many years studying chimpanzees. One evening, he noticed that two chimpanzees ① <u>leave</u> outside their shelter during a heavy rainstorm. After approaching them and unlocking the shelter door, he stepped to the side, expecting them to enter the shelter as ② <u>quick</u> as possible. However, before doing so, they paused to hug Köhler, one around his legs and ③ <u>another</u> around his chest, despite the rain that continued to pour down. It was only after expressing their gratitude in this way that they went inside. Similar behavior was observed by the famous researcher Jane Goodall after she rescued a chimpanzee that was near death and cared for it until it recovered.",

The combination of the weight of the person and the slight movement of the tile is used to create an electrical current. <u>When stepped on</u>, the rubber tiles move downward by about five millimeters. That's not much, but it's enough to create kinetic energy, which is stored in a battery. These tiles are currently being used in London, where they can be found in a subway station and on the sidewalk in front of a shopping mall.",

After approaching them and ③ <u>unlocking</u> the shelter door, he stepped to the side, expecting them to enter the shelter as quickly as possible. However, before doing so, they paused ④ <u>to hug</u> Köhler, one around his legs and the other around his chest, despite the rain that continued to pour down. It was only after expressing their gratitude in this way ⑤ <u>in which</u> they went inside. Similar behavior was observed by the famous researcher Jane Goodall after she rescued a chimpanzee that was near death and cared for it until it recovered. When the chimpanzee was brought back to the jungle, it warmly embraced Goodall before departing.",

These sounds can have a physical effect on our body. One researcher showed that a certain infrasound frequency has an interesting effect on our eyes. This was discovered when he saw a mysterious gray blob out of the corner of his eye while working late one night. Trying to determine its cause, he eventually realized that <u>a fan in his room was emitting a frequency of 18.98 Hz</u>. This is very similar to the resonant frequency of the human eye. Therefore, he concluded that the gray blob was actually caused by resonation in his eyes. Based on his research, he created a theory that \"ghosts\" are just optical illusions caused by infrasound.",

This was discovered when he saw a mysterious gray blob out of the corner of his eye while working late one night. Trying to determine its cause, he eventually realized that a fan in his room was emitting a frequency of 18.98 Hz. This is very similar to the resonant frequency of the human eye. Therefore, he concluded that the gray blob was actually caused by resonation in his eyes. Based on his research, he created a theory that \"ghosts\" are just __________.",

Upstream reciprocity refers to the way that being the recipient of a kind action makes it more likely for people to perform a kind act for someone else in the future. In the study, the monkeys and the children were both tested in the same way. After one individual did something nice for another, that individual was taken out of the testing area. Then a new individual was brought in. Both the children and the monkeys were more likely to perform a kind act for the new individual if they had been the recipient of the kind act themselves. They did not have a chance to repay whoever had done something nice for them but instead chose to pay it forward. The researchers who performed the experiment suggested that the motivation behind these actions is the feeling of gratitude.",

After all, while the costs of such behaviors are borne by certain individuals, it is generally others who get to enjoy the benefits. It is true that, in some cases, an individual cooperator may receive benefits that balance the costs of their actions. However, this was probably not the case in the majority of situations in which cooperation was necessary to our ancestors' survival. Consider life-and-death situations involving defense against predators and environmental crises. Anyone who acted purely out of self-preservation in such cases would not have exhibited cooperative behavior, no matter what they thought other individuals might do. Therefore, in order for cooperative behaviors to be passed down across multiple generations, other factors must have been involved. In particular, some of the people involved in dangerous situations must have been motivated at least in part by potential social rewards.",

An early observation of this phenomenon was made by Wolfgang Köhler, a psychologist who spent many years studying chimpanzees. One evening, he noticed that two chimpanzees had been left outside their shelter during a heavy rainstorm. After approaching them and unlocking the shelter door, he stepped to the side, expecting them to enter the shelter as quickly as possible. However, before doing so, they paused to hug Köhler, one around his legs and the other around his chest, despite the rain that continued to pour down. It was only after expressing their gratitude in this way that they went inside. Similar behavior was observed by the famous researcher Jane Goodall after she rescued a chimpanzee that was near death and cared for it until it recovered. When the chimpanzee was brought back to the jungle, it warmly embraced Goodall before departing.",

To understand how trends can ultimately give individuals power and freedom, one must first discuss fashion's importance as a basis for change. The most common explanation offered by my informants as to why fashion is so appealing is that it constitutes a kind of theatrical costumery. Clothes are part of how people present themselves to the world, and fashion locates them in the present, relative to what is happening in society and to fashion's own history. As a form of expression, fashion contains a host of ambiguities, enabling individuals to recreate the meanings associated with specific pieces of clothing. Fashion is among the simplest and cheapest methods of self-expression: clothes can be inexpensively purchased while making it easy to convey notions of wealth, intellectual stature, relaxation or environmental consciousness, even if none of these is true. Fashion can also strengthen agency in various ways, opening up space for action.",

            "text": "It is not only humans that express gratitude, but primates as well. An early observation of this phenomenon was made by Wolfgang Köhler, a psychologist who spent many years studying chimpanzees. One evening, he noticed that two chimpanzees had been left outside their shelter during a heavy rainstorm. After approaching them and unlocking the shelter door, he stepped to the side, expecting them to enter the shelter as quickly as possible. However, before doing so, they paused to hug Köhler, one around his legs and the other around his chest, despite the rain that continued to pour down. <u>그들은 안으로 들어간 것은 바로 이렇게 감사를 표하고 나서였다</u>.",

These sounds can have a physical effect on our body. One researcher showed that a certain infrasound frequency has an interesting effect on our eyes. This was discovered when he saw a mysterious gray blob out of the corner of his eye while working late one night. Trying to determine its cause, he eventually realized that a fan in his room was emitting a frequency of 18.98 Hz. This is very similar to the resonant frequency of the human eye. Therefore, he concluded that the gray blob was actually caused by resonation in his eyes. Based on his research, he created a theory that <u>유령은 단지 초저주파 음에 의해 야기되는 시각적 환상이다</u>.",

It was discovered that people with type AB blood tend to have more of a blood protein called the von Willebrand factor, which can cause clotting at high concentrations. Although not everyone with type AB blood will suffer from blood clots, this discovery allows us to identify people at higher risk and thus prepare to protect them.",

For millions of years this was a highly rational and effective strategy because the light on a dark beach represented the reflection of the moon and stars on the water's surface. Following the lights led baby turtles back home to the sea. The problems started when humans began building beachfront homes and sparkling hotels on the other side of the beach. Now after hatching, turtles heading for the brightest nearby lights were being guided straight into traffic. Are self- destructive sea turtles naturally irrational? Yes, in the modern world. But there's a deeper truth. Turtles are basing their decisions on simple cues that were perfectly rational for their ancestors; these days, however, their evolved decision-making mechanisms are being blinded by modern lights.",

For instance, an exposed brain would neither sense light shining on it nor feel something touching it. In fact, patients are often kept awake during brain surgery, which can help a surgeon isolate specific regions of the brain. The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle recognized this characteristic of the brain over 2,000 years ago when he said, \"Nothing is in the mind that does not pass through the senses.\" This concept can be seen clearly when volunteers are blind-folded and placed in the warm water of a sensory deprivation tank. They soon experience visual, auditory, and tactile (touch) hallucinations, as well as incoherent thought patterns. From these experiments and others, it is apparent that we need constant input from our senses to carry out functions that give us personality and intellect.",

Why are the feet and legs such accurate reflectors of our sentiments? For millions of years, long before humans spoke, our legs and feet reacted to environmental threats (e.g., hot sand, ill- tempered lions) instantaneously, without the need for conscious thought. Our limbic brains made sure that our feet and legs reacted as needed by either ceasing motion, running away, or kicking at a potential threat. This survival regimen, retained from our ancestral heritage, has served us well and continues to do so today. In fact, these age-old reactions are still so hardwired in us that when we are presented with something dangerous or even disagreeable, our feet and legs still react as they did in prehistoric times.",

Stone and clay tablets were used, but they were prone to fracture and were bulky and heavy to transport. Wood suffers from splitting and is susceptible to decay. Wall paintings are static and space is limited. The invention of paper, said to be one of the four great inventions of the Chinese, solved these problems, but it wasn't until the Romans replaced the scroll with the codex — or, as we call it now, the book — that the material reached its full potential. That was two thousand years ago, and it is still a dominant form of the written word. That paper, a much softer material than either stone or wood, won out as the guardian of the written word is a remarkable materials story.",

No matter how we might state it in shorthand, it is, analytically, a complex interaction of many ideas and implications. The reason must be broken down into a chain of more precise premises. For example, the claim that 'university education should be free for all Australians' might be supported by the reason that 'the economy benefits from a well-educated Australian population'. But is our analysis of the situation clearly expressed in just one statement? Hardly. The conclusion is about universities and free education, while the reason introduces some new ideas: economic benefit and a well-educated population. While the link between these two ideas and the conclusion might seem obvious, the purpose of reasoning is to avoid assuming the 'obvious' by carefully working through the connections between the various ideas in the initial statement of our reason.",

For example, migrants are assumed to overcrowd cities, clog up labor markets, and increase poverty. The other questionable assumption is that most migration is involuntary—people fleeing natural or man-made disasters. The reality, however, is more complex, and many migrants are simply seeking greater economic opportunity. Of course migration can and does create social and economic problems. But migration can also be a solution for many preexisting problems. For example, out-migration generally redistributes workers from places of labor surplus to areas where there is greater demand or more opportunity. Migration is generally selective of persons who are younger, healthier, more flexible, and more willing to endure hardship in hopes of a better life relative to their prospects in their places of origin. Most research that examines long-term outcomes of migration, including remittances and intergenerational mobility, finds positive \"long-term\" effects on places of origin and destination.",

Whether among ancient kings or modern politicians, this has happened again and again over the centuries, leading to inflation and the many economic and social problems that follow from inflation. For this reason, many countries have preferred using gold, silver, or some other material that is inherently limited in supply, as money. It is a way of depriving governments of the power to expand the money supply to inflationary levels. Gold has long been considered ideal for this purpose, since the supply of gold in the world usually cannot be increased rapidly. When paper money is convertible into gold whenever the individual chooses to do so, then the money is said to be \"backed up\" by gold. This expression is misleading only if we imagine that the value of the gold is somehow transferred to the paper money, when in fact the real point is that the gold simply limits the amount of paper money that can be issued.",

            "text": "The study of emotions and decision making is now of considerable importance. This involves the application of various tools afforded by neuroscience. One important stream of the literature examines people with brain damage and how damage to particular parts of the brain known to be responsible for particular cognitive functions impacts on decision making. One example of this research is the work of Antonio Damasio, who finds that when the emotional part of the brain is damaged, this actually reduces the efficacy of decision making. Good decisions are a product of the emotional part of the brain working in conjunction with the deliberative part. This contradicts the assumptions of conventional economics, where emotions play a negative role in the decision-making process. Here it is assumed that decision making can be modeled as being generated in a stoic, unemotional fashion, and that's why decisions tend to be optimal. But the evidence suggests that emotions actually play an important and, often, a positive role in decision making.",

For millions of years this was a highly rational and effective strategy because the light on a dark beach represented the reflection of the moon and stars on the water's surface. Following the lights led baby turtles back home to the sea. The problems started when humans began building beachfront homes and sparkling hotels on the other side of the beach. Now after hatching, turtles heading for the brightest nearby lights were being guided straight into traffic. Are self-destructive sea turtles naturally irrational? Yes, in the modern world. But there's a deeper truth. Turtles are basing their decisions on simple cues that were perfectly rational for their ancestors; these days, however, their evolved decision-making mechanisms are being <u>blinded by modern lights</u>.",

For instance, an exposed brain would neither sense light shining on it nor feel something touching it. In fact, patients are often kept awake during brain surgery, which can help a surgeon isolate specific regions of the brain. The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle recognized this characteristic of the brain over 2,000 years ago when he said, <u>\"Nothing is in the mind that does not pass through the senses.\"</u> This concept can be seen clearly when volunteers are blind-folded and placed in the warm water of a sensory deprivation tank. They soon experience visual, auditory, and tactile (touch) hallucinations, as well as incoherent thought patterns. From these experiments and others, it is apparent that we need constant input from our senses to carry out functions that give us personality and intellect.",

Why are the feet and legs such accurate reflectors of our sentiments? For millions of years, long before humans spoke, our legs and feet reacted to environmental threats (e.g., hot sand, ill- tempered lions) instantaneously, without the need for conscious thought. Our limbic brains made sure that our feet and legs reacted as needed by either ceasing motion, running away, or kicking at a potential threat. This survival regimen, retained from our ancestral heritage, has served us well and continues to do so today. In fact, these age-old reactions are still so hardwired in us that when we are presented with something dangerous or even disagreeable, <u>our feet and legs still react as they did in prehistoric times</u>.",

Wall paintings are static and space is limited. The invention of paper, said to be one of the four great inventions of the Chinese, solved these problems, but it wasn't until the Romans replaced the scroll with the codex — or, as we call it now, the book — that the material reached its full potential. That was two thousand years ago, and it is still a dominant form of the written word. That paper, a much softer material than either stone or wood, won out as the <u>guardian of the written word</u> is a remarkable materials story.",

No matter how we might state it in shorthand, it is, analytically, a complex interaction of many ideas and implications. The reason must be broken down into a chain of more precise premises. For example, the claim that 'university education should be free for all Australians' might be supported by the reason that 'the economy benefits from a well-educated Australian population'. But is our analysis of the situation clearly expressed in just one statement? Hardly. The conclusion is about universities and free education, while the reason introduces some new ideas: economic benefit and a well-educated population.

For example, migrants are assumed to overcrowd cities, clog up labor markets, and increase poverty. The other questionable assumption is that most migration is involuntary—people fleeing natural or man-made disasters. The reality, however, is more complex, and many migrants are simply seeking greater economic opportunity. Of course migration can and does create social and economic problems. But <u>migration can also be a solution for many preexisting problems</u>. For example, out-migration generally redistributes workers from places of labor surplus to areas where there is greater demand or more opportunity. Migration is generally selective of persons who are younger, healthier, more flexible, and more willing to endure hardship in hopes of a better life relative to their prospects in their places of origin. Most research that examines long-term outcomes of migration, including remittances and intergenerational mobility, finds positive \"long-term\" effects on places of origin and destination.",

            "text": "The study of emotions and decision making is now of considerable importance. This involves the application of various tools afforded by neuroscience. One important stream of the literature examines people with brain damage and how damage to particular parts of the brain known to be responsible for particular cognitive functions impacts on decision making. One example of this research is the work of Antonio Damasio, who finds that <u>when the emotional part of the brain is damaged, this actually reduces the efficacy of decision making</u>. Good decisions are a product of the emotional part of the brain working in conjunction with the deliberative part. This contradicts the assumptions of conventional economics, where emotions play a negative role in the decision-making process. Here it is assumed that decision making can be modeled as being generated in a stoic, unemotional fashion, and that's why decisions tend to be optimal. But the evidence suggests that emotions actually play an important and, often, a positive role in decision making.",

For millions of years this was a highly rational and effective strategy because the light on a dark beach represented the reflection of the moon and stars on the water's surface. Following the lights led baby turtles back home to the sea. The problems started when humans began building beachfront homes and sparkling hotels on the other side of the beach. Now after hatching, turtles heading for the brightest nearby lights were being guided straight into traffic. Are self- destructive sea turtles naturally irrational? Yes, in the modern world. But there's a deeper truth. Turtles are basing their decisions on simple cues that were perfectly rational for their ancestors; these days, however, their evolved decision-making mechanisms are being blinded by modern lights.",

For instance, an exposed brain would neither sense light shining on it nor feel something touching it. In fact, patients are often kept awake during brain surgery, which can help a surgeon isolate specific regions of the brain. The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle recognized this characteristic of the brain over 2,000 years ago when he said, \"Nothing is in the mind that does not pass through the senses.\" This concept can be seen clearly when volunteers are blind-folded and placed in the warm water of a sensory deprivation tank. They soon experience visual, auditory, and tactile (touch) hallucinations, as well as incoherent thought patterns. From these experiments and others, it is apparent that we need constant input from our senses to carry out functions that give us personality and intellect.",

No matter how we might state it in shorthand, it is, analytically, a complex interaction of many ideas and implications. The reason must be broken down into a chain of more precise premises. For example, the claim that 'university education should be free for all Australians' might be supported by the reason that 'the economy benefits from a well-educated Australian population'. But is our analysis of the situation clearly expressed in just one statement? Hardly. The conclusion is about universities and free education, while the reason introduces some new ideas: economic benefit and a well-educated population. While the link between these two ideas and the conclusion might seem obvious, the purpose of reasoning is to avoid assuming the 'obvious' by carefully working through the connections between the various ideas in the initial statement of our reason.",

            "text": "The study of emotions and decision making is now of considerable importance. This involves the application of various tools afforded by neuroscience. One important stream of the literature examines people with brain damage and how damage to particular parts of the brain known to be responsible for particular cognitive functions impacts on decision making. One example of this research is the work of Antonio Damasio, who finds that when the emotional part of the brain is damaged, this actually reduces the efficacy of decision making. Good decisions are a product of the emotional part of the brain working in conjunction with the deliberative part. This contradicts the assumptions of conventional economics, where emotions play a negative role in the decision-making process. Here it is assumed that decision making can be modeled as being generated in a stoic, unemotional fashion, and that's why decisions tend to be optimal. But the evidence suggests that emotions actually play an important and, often, a positive role in decision making.",

For millions of years this was a highly rational and effective strategy because the light on a dark beach represented the reflection of the moon and stars on the water's surface. Following the lights led baby turtles back home to the sea. The problems started when humans began building beachfront homes and sparkling hotels on the other side of the beach. Now after hatching, turtles heading for the brightest nearby lights were being guided straight into traffic. Are self- destructive sea turtles naturally irrational? Yes, in the modern world. But there's a deeper truth. Turtles are basing their decisions on simple cues that were perfectly rational for their ancestors; these days, however, their evolved decision-making mechanisms are being blinded by modern lights.",

In fact, patients are often kept awake during brain surgery, which can help a surgeon isolate specific regions of the brain. The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle recognized this characteristic of the brain over 2,000 years ago when he said, \"Nothing is in the mind that does not pass through the senses.\" This concept can be seen clearly when volunteers are blind-folded and placed in the warm water of a sensory deprivation tank. They soon experience visual, auditory, and tactile (touch) hallucinations, as well as incoherent thought patterns. From these experiments and others, it is apparent that we need constant input from our senses to carry out functions that give us personality and intellect.",

Why are the feet and legs such accurate reflectors of our sentiments? For millions of years, long before humans spoke, our legs and feet reacted to environmental threats (e.g., hot sand, ill- tempered lions) instantaneously, without the need for conscious thought. Our limbic brains made sure that our feet and legs reacted as needed by either ceasing motion, running away, or kicking at a potential threat. This survival regimen, retained from our ancestral heritage, has served us well and continues to do so today. In fact, these age-old reactions are still so hardwired in us that when we are presented with something dangerous or even disagreeable, our feet and legs still react as they did in prehistoric times.",

Stone and clay tablets were used, but they were prone to fracture and were bulky and heavy to transport. Wood suffers from splitting and is susceptible to decay. Wall paintings are static and space is limited. The invention of paper, said to be one of the four great inventions of the Chinese, solved these problems, but it wasn't until the Romans replaced the scroll with the codex — or, as we call it now, the book — that the material reached its full potential. That was two thousand years ago, and it is still a dominant form of the written word. That paper, a much softer material than either stone or wood, won out as the guardian of the written word is a remarkable materials story.",

No matter how we might state it in shorthand, it is, analytically, a complex interaction of many ideas and implications. The reason must be broken down into a chain of more precise premises. For example, the claim that 'university education should be free for all Australians' might be supported by the reason that 'the economy benefits from a welleducated Australian population'. But is our analysis of the situation clearly expressed in just one statement? Hardly. The conclusion is about universities and free education, while the reason introduces some new ideas: economic benefit and a well-educated population. While the link between these two ideas and the conclusion might seem obvious, the purpose of reasoning is to avoid assuming the 'obvious' by carefully working through the connections between the various ideas in the initial statement of our reason.",

For example, migrants are assumed to overcrowd cities, clog up labor markets, and increase poverty. The other questionable assumption is that most migration is involuntary—people fleeing natural or man-made disasters. The reality, however, is more complex, and many migrants are simply seeking greater economic opportunity. Of course migration can and does create social and economic problems. But migration can also be a solution for many preexisting problems. For example, out-migration generally redistributes workers from places of labor surplus to areas where there is greater demand or more opportunity. Migration is generally selective of persons who are younger, healthier, more flexible, and more willing to endure hardship in hopes of a better life relative to their prospects in their places of origin. Most research that examines longterm outcomes of migration, including remittances and intergenerational mobility, finds positive \"long-term\" effects on places of origin and destination.",

Whether among ancient kings or modern politicians, this has happened again and again over the centuries, leading to inflation and the many economic and social problems that follow from inflation. For this reason, many countries have preferred using gold, silver, or some other material that is inherently limited in supply, as money. It is a way of depriving governments of the power to expand the money supply to inflationary levels. Gold has long been considered ideal for this purpose, since the supply of gold in the world usually cannot be increased rapidly. When paper money is convertible into gold whenever the individual chooses to do so, then the money is said to be \"backed up\" by gold. This expression is misleading only if we imagine that the value of the gold is somehow transferred to the paper money, when in fact the real point is that the gold simply limits the amount of paper money that can be issued.",

            "text": "The study of emotions and decision making is now of considerable importance. This involves the application of various tools afforded by neuroscience. One important stream of the literature examines people with brain damage and how damage to particular parts of the brain known to be responsible for particular cognitive functions impacts on decision making. One example of this research is the work of Antonio Damasio, who finds that when the emotional part of the brain is damaged, this actually reduces the efficacy of decision making. Good decisions are a product of the emotional part of the brain working in conjunction with the deliberative part. This contradicts the assumptions of conventional economics, where emotions play a negative role in the decision-making process. Here it is assumed that decision making can be modeled as being generated in a stoic, unemotional fashion, and that's why decisions tend to be optimal. But the evidence suggests that emotions actually play an important and, often, a positive role in decision making.",

For millions of years this was a highly rational and effective strategy because the light on a dark beach represented the reflection of the moon and stars on the water's surface. Following the lights led baby turtles back home to the sea. The problems started when humans began building beachfront homes and sparkling hotels on the other side of the beach. Now after hatching, turtles heading for the brightest nearby lights were being guided straight into traffic. Are self- destructive sea turtles naturally irrational? Yes, in the modern world. But there's a deeper truth. Turtles are basing their decisions on simple cues that were perfectly rational for their ancestors; these days, however, their evolved decision-making mechanisms are being blinded by modern lights.",

For instance, an exposed brain would neither sense light shining on it nor feel something touching it. In fact, patients are often kept awake during brain surgery, which can help a surgeon isolate specific regions of the brain. The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle recognized this characteristic of the brain over 2,000 years ago when he said, \"Nothing is in the mind that does not pass through the senses.\" This concept can be seen clearly when volunteers are blind-folded and placed in the warm water of a sensory deprivation tank. They soon experience visual, auditory, and tactile (touch) hallucinations, as well as incoherent thought patterns. From these experiments and others, it is apparent that we need constant input from our senses to carry out functions that give us personality and intellect.",

Why are the feet and legs such accurate reflectors of our sentiments? For millions of years, long before humans spoke, our legs and feet reacted to environmental threats (e.g., hot sand, ill- tempered lions) instantaneously, without the need for conscious thought. Our limbic brains made sure that our feet and legs reacted as needed by either ceasing motion, running away, or kicking at a potential threat. This survival regimen, retained from our ancestral heritage, has served us well and continues to do so today. In fact, these age-old reactions are still so hardwired in us that when we are presented with something dangerous or even disagreeable, our feet and legs still react as they did in prehistoric times.",

Stone and clay tablets were used, but they were prone to fracture and were bulky and heavy to transport. Wood suffers from splitting and is susceptible to decay. Wall paintings are static and space is limited. The invention of paper, said to be one of the four great inventions of the Chinese, solved these problems, but it wasn't until the Romans replaced the scroll with the codex — or, as we call it now, the book — that the material reached its full potential. That was two thousand years ago, and it is still a dominant form of the written word. That paper, a much softer material than either stone or wood, won out as the guardian of the written word is a remarkable materials story.",

No matter how we might state it in shorthand, it is, analytically, a complex interaction of many ideas and implications. The reason must be broken down into a chain of more precise premises. For example, the claim that 'university education should be free for all Australians' might be supported by the reason that 'the economy benefits from a well-educated Australian population'. But is our analysis of the situation clearly expressed in just one statement? Hardly. The conclusion is about universities and free education, while the reason introduces some new ideas: economic benefit and a well-educated population. While the link between these two ideas and the conclusion might seem obvious, the purpose of reasoning is to avoid assuming the 'obvious' by carefully working through the connections between the various ideas in the initial statement of our reason.",

For example, migrants are assumed to overcrowd cities, clog up labor markets, and increase poverty. The other questionable assumption is that most migration is involuntary—people fleeing natural or man-made disasters. The reality, however, is more complex, and many migrants are simply seeking greater economic opportunity. Of course migration can and does create social and economic problems. But migration can also be a solution for many preexisting problems. For example, out-migration generally redistributes workers from places of labor surplus to areas where there is greater demand or more opportunity. Migration is generally selective of persons who are younger, healthier, more flexible, and more willing to endure hardship in hopes of a better life relative to their prospects in their places of origin. Most research that examines long-term outcomes of migration, including remittances and intergenerational mobility, finds positive \"long-term\" effects on places of origin and destination.",

Whether among ancient kings or modern politicians, this has happened again and again over the centuries, leading to inflation and the many economic and social problems that follow from inflation. For this reason, many countries have preferred using gold, silver, or some other material that is inherently limited in supply, as money. It is a way of depriving governments of the power to expand the money supply to inflationary levels. Gold has long been considered ideal for this purpose, since the supply of gold in the world usually cannot be increased rapidly. When paper money is convertible into gold whenever the individual chooses to do so, then the money is said to be \"backed up\" by gold. This expression is misleading only if we imagine that the value of the gold is somehow transferred to the paper money, when in fact the real point is that the gold simply limits the amount of paper money that can be issued.",

            "text": "The study of emotions and decision making is now of considerable importance. This involves the application of various tools afforded by neuroscience. One important stream of the literature examines people with brain damage and how damage to particular parts of the brain known to be responsible for particular cognitive functions impacts on decision making. One example of this research is the work of Antonio Damasio, who finds that when the emotional part of the brain is damaged, this actually reduces the efficacy of decision making. Good decisions are a product of the emotional part of the brain working in conjunction with the deliberative part. This contradicts the assumptions of conventional economics, where emotions play a negative role in the decision-making process. Here it is assumed that decision making can be modeled as being generated in a stoic, unemotional fashion, and that's why decisions tend to be optimal. But the evidence suggests that emotions actually play an important and, often, a positive role in decision making.",

For millions of years this was a highly rational and effective strategy because the light on a dark beach represented the reflection of the moon and stars on the water's surface. Following the lights led baby turtles back home to the sea. The problems started when humans began building beachfront homes and sparkling hotels on the other side of the beach. Now after hatching, turtles heading for the brightest nearby lights were being guided straight into traffic. Are self-destructive sea turtles naturally irrational? Yes, in the modern world. But there's a deeper truth. Turtles are basing their decisions on simple __________ that were perfectly rational for their ancestors; these days, however, their evolved decision-making mechanisms are being blinded by modern lights.",

For instance, an exposed brain would neither sense light shining on it nor feel something touching it. In fact, patients are often kept awake during brain surgery, which can help a surgeon isolate specific regions of the brain. The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle recognized this __________ of the brain over 2,000 years ago when he said, \"Nothing is in the mind that does not pass through the senses.\" This concept can be seen clearly when volunteers are blind-folded and placed in the warm water of a sensory deprivation tank. They soon experience visual, auditory, and tactile (touch) hallucinations, as well as incoherent thought patterns. From these experiments and others, it is apparent that we need constant input from our senses to carry out functions that give us personality and intellect.",

Our limbic brains made sure that our feet and legs reacted as needed by either ceasing motion, running away, or kicking at a potential threat. This __________ regimen, retained from our ancestral heritage, has served us well and continues to do so today.

Stone and clay tablets were used, but they were prone to fracture and were bulky and heavy to transport. Wood suffers from splitting and is susceptible to decay. Wall paintings are static and space is limited. The invention of __________ said to be one of the four great inventions of the Chinese, solved these problems, but it wasn't until the Romans replaced the scroll with the codex — or, as we call it now, the book - that the material reached its full potential. That was two thousand years ago, and it is still a dominant form of the written word. That paper, a much softer material than either stone or wood, won out as the guardian of the written word is a remarkable materials story.",

But is our analysis of the situation clearly expressed in just one statement? Hardly. The conclusion is about universities and free education, while the reason introduces some new ideas: economic benefit and a well-educated population.

The reality, however, is more complex, and many migrants are simply seeking greater economic opportunity. Of course migration can and does create social and economic problems. But migration can also be a solution for many preexisting problems. For example, out-migration generally redistributes workers from places of labor surplus to areas where there is greater demand or more opportunity. Migration is generally selective of persons who are younger, healthier, more flexible, and more willing to endure hardship in hopes of a better life relative to their prospects in their places of origin. Most research that examines longterm outcomes of migration, including remittances and intergenerational mobility, finds positive \"long-term\" effects on places of origin and destination.",

Whether among ancient kings or modern politicians, this has happened again and again over the centuries, leading to inflation and the many economic and social problems that follow from inflation. For this reason, many countries have preferred using gold, silver, or some other material that is inherently __________ in supply, as money. It is a way of depriving governments of the power to expand the money supply to inflationary levels. Gold has long been considered ideal for this purpose, since the supply of gold in the world usually cannot be increased rapidly. When paper money is convertible into gold whenever the individual chooses to do so, then the money is said to be \"backed up\" by gold. This expression is misleading only if we imagine that the value of the gold is somehow transferred to the paper money, when in fact the real point is that the gold simply limits the amount of paper money that can be issued.",

One important stream of the literature examines people with brain damage and how damage to particular parts of the brain known to be responsible for particular cognitive functions impacts on decision making. One example of this research is the work of Antonio Damasio, who finds that when the emotional part of the brain is damaged, this actually reduces the __________ of decision making. Good decisions are a product of the emotional part of the brain working in conjunction with the deliberative part. This contradicts the assumptions of conventional economics, where emotions play a negative role in the decision-making process. Here it is assumed that decision making can be modeled as being generated in a stoic, unemotional fashion, and that's why decisions tend to be optimal. But the evidence suggests that emotions actually play an important and, often, a positive role in decision making.",

For millions of years this was a highly rational and effective strategy because the light on a dark beach represented the reflection of the moon and stars on the water's surface. Following the lights led baby turtles back home to the sea. The problems started when humans began building beachfront homes and sparkling hotels on the other side of the beach. Now after hatching, turtles heading for __________ were being guided straight into traffic. Are self-destructive sea turtles naturally irrational? Yes, in the modern world. But there's a deeper truth. Turtles are basing their decisions on simple cues that were perfectly rational for their ancestors; these days, however, their evolved decision-making mechanisms are being blinded by modern lights.",

Stone and clay tablets were used, but they were prone to fracture and were bulky and heavy to transport. Wood suffers from splitting and is susceptible to decay. Wall paintings are static and space is limited. The invention of paper, said to be one of the four great inventions of the Chinese, solved these problems, but it wasn't until the Romans replaced the scroll with the codex — or, as we call it now, the book — that the material reached its full potential. That was two thousand years ago, and it is still a dominant form of the written word. That paper, a much softer material than either stone or wood, won out as the guardian of the written word is a remarkable materials story.",

But is our analysis of the situation clearly expressed in just one statement? Hardly. The conclusion is about universities and free education, while the reason introduces some new ideas: economic benefit and a well—educated population.

For example, migrants are assumed to overcrowd cities, clog up labor markets, and increase poverty. The other questionable assumption is that most migration is involuntary—people fleeing natural or man-made disasters. The reality, however, is more complex, and many migrants are simply seeking greater economic opportunity. Of course migration can and does create social and economic problems. But migration can also be __________ for many preexisting problems. For example, out-migration generally redistributes workers from places of labor surplus to areas where there is greater demand or more opportunity. Migration is generally selective of persons who are younger, healthier, more flexible, and more willing to endure hardship in hopes of a better life relative to their prospects in their places of origin. Most research that examines long-term outcomes of migration, including remittances and intergenerational mobility, finds positive \"long-term\" effects on places of origin and destination.",

Whether among ancient kings or modern politicians, this has happened again and again over the centuries, leading to inflation and the many economic and social problems that follow from inflation. For this reason, many countries have preferred using gold, silver, or some other material that is inherently limited in supply, as money. It is a way of __________ to inflationary levels. Gold has long been considered ideal for this purpose, since the supply of gold in the world usually cannot be increased rapidly. When paper money is convertible into gold whenever the individual chooses to do so, then the money is said to be \"backed up\" by gold. This expression is misleading only if we imagine that the value of the gold is somehow transferred to the paper money, when in fact the real point is that the gold simply limits the amount of paper money that can be issued.",

One important stream of the literature examines people with brain damage and how damage to particular parts of the brain known to be responsible for particular cognitive functions impacts on decision making. One example of this research is the work of Antonio Damasio, who finds that when the emotional part of the brain is damaged, this actually reduces the efficacy of decision making. Good decisions are a product of the emotional part of the brain working in conjunction with the deliberative part. This contradicts the assumptions of conventional economics, where emotions play __________ in the decision-making process. Here it is assumed that decision making can be modeled as being generated in a stoic, unemotional fashion, and that's why decisions tend to be optimal. But the evidence suggests that emotions actually play an important and, often, a positive role in decision making.",

(⑤) But the evidence suggests that emotions actually play an important and, often, a positive role in decision making.",

For millions of years this was a highly rational and effective strategy because the light on a dark beach represented the reflection of the moon and stars on the water's surface. Following the lights led baby turtles back home to the sea. The problems started when humans began building beachfront homes and sparkling hotels on the other side of the beach. Now after hatching, turtles heading for the brightest nearby lights were being guided straight into traffic. Are self- destructive sea turtles naturally irrational? Yes, in the modern world. But there's a deeper truth. Turtles are basing their decisions on simple cues that were perfectly rational for their ancestors; these days, however, their evolved decision-making mechanisms are being blinded by modern lights.",

For instance, an exposed brain would neither sense light shining on it nor feel something touching it. In fact, patients are often kept awake during brain surgery, which can help a surgeon isolate specific regions of the brain. The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle recognized this characteristic of the brain over 2,000 years ago when he said, \"Nothing is in the mind that does not pass through the senses.\" This concept can be seen clearly when volunteers are blind-folded and placed in the warm water of a sensory deprivation tank. They soon experience visual, auditory, and tactile (touch) hallucinations, as well as incoherent thought patterns. From these experiments and others, it is apparent that we need constant input from our senses to carry out functions that give us personality and intellect.",

Why are the feet and legs such accurate reflectors of our sentiments? For millions of years, long before humans spoke, our legs and feet reacted to environmental threats (e.g., hot sand, ill- tempered lions) instantaneously, without the need for conscious thought. Our limbic brains made sure that our feet and legs reacted as needed by either ceasing motion, running away, or kicking at a potential threat. This survival regimen, retained from our ancestral heritage, has served us well and continues to do so today. In fact, these age-old reactions are still so hardwired in us that when we are presented with something dangerous or even disagreeable, our feet and legs still react as they did in prehistoric times.",

Stone and clay tablets were used, but they were prone to fracture and were bulky and heavy to transport. Wood suffers from splitting and is susceptible to decay. Wall paintings are static and space is limited. The invention of paper, said to be one of the four great inventions of the Chinese, solved these problems, but it wasn't until the Romans replaced the scroll with the codex — or, as we call it now, the book — that the material reached its full potential. That was two thousand years ago, and it is still a dominant form of the written word. That paper, a much softer material than either stone or wood, won out as the guardian of the written word is a remarkable materials story.",

No matter how we might state it in shorthand, it is, analytically, a complex interaction of many ideas and implications. The reason must be broken down into a chain of more precise premises. For example, the claim that 'university education should be free for all Australians' might be supported by the reason that 'the economy benefits from a well-educated Australian population'. But is our analysis of the situation clearly expressed in just one statement? Hardly. The conclusion is about universities and free education, while the reason introduces some new ideas: economic benefit and a well-educated population. While the link between these two ideas and the conclusion might seem obvious, the purpose of reasoning is to avoid assuming the 'obvious' by carefully working through the connections between the various ideas in the initial statement of our reason.",

For example, migrants are assumed to overcrowd cities, clog up labor markets, and increase poverty. The other questionable assumption is that most migration is involuntary—people fleeing natural or man-made disasters. The reality, however, is more complex, and many migrants are simply seeking greater economic opportunity. Of course migration can and does create social and economic problems. But migration can also be a solution for many preexisting problems. For example, out-migration generally redistributes workers from places of labor surplus to areas where there is greater demand or more opportunity. Migration is generally selective of persons who are younger, healthier, more flexible, and more willing to endure hardship in hopes of a better life relative to their prospects in their places of origin. Most research that examines long-term outcomes of migration, including remittances and intergenerational mobility, finds positive \"long-term\" effects on places of origin and destination.",

Whether among ancient kings or modern politicians, this has happened again and again over the centuries, leading to inflation and the many economic and social problems that follow from inflation. For this reason, many countries have preferred using gold, silver, or some other material that is inherently limited in supply, as money. It is a way of depriving governments of the power to expand the money supply to inflationary levels. Gold has long been considered ideal for this purpose, since the supply of gold in the world usually cannot be increased rapidly. When paper money is convertible into gold whenever the individual chooses to do so, then the money is said to be \"backed up\" by gold. This expression is misleading only if we imagine that the value of the gold is somehow transferred to the paper money, when in fact the real point is that the gold simply limits the amount of paper money that can be issued.",

One important stream of the literature examines people with brain damage and how damage to particular parts of the brain known to be responsible for particular cognitive functions impacts on decision making. One example of this research is the work of Antonio Damasio, who finds that when the emotional part of the brain is damaged, this actually reduces the efficacy of decision making. Good decisions are a product of the emotional part of the brain working in conjunction with the deliberative part. This contradicts the assumptions of conventional economics, where emotions play a negative role in the decision-making process. Here it is assumed that decision making can be modeled as being generated in a stoic, unemotional fashion, and that's why decisions tend to be optimal. But the evidence suggests that emotions actually play an important and, often, a positive role in decision making.",

For millions of years this was a highly rational and effective strategy because the light on a dark beach represented the reflection of the moon and stars on the water's surface. Following the lights led baby turtles back home to the sea. The problems started when humans began building beachfront homes and sparkling hotels on the other side of the beach. Now after hatching, turtles heading for the brightest nearby lights were being guided straight into traffic. Are self-destructive sea turtles naturally irrational? Yes, in the modern world. But there's a deeper truth. Turtles are basing their decisions on simple cues that were perfectly rational for their ancestors; these days, however, their evolved decision-making mechanisms are being blinded by modern lights.",

For instance, an exposed brain would neither sense light shining on it nor feel something touching it. In fact, patients are often kept awake during brain surgery, which can help a surgeon isolate specific regions of the brain. The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle recognized this characteristic of the brain over 2,000 years ago when he said, \"Nothing is in the mind that does not pass through the senses.\" This concept can be seen clearly when volunteers are blind-folded and placed in the warm water of a sensory deprivation tank. They soon experience visual, auditory, and tactile (touch) hallucinations, as well as incoherent thought patterns. From these experiments and others, it is apparent that we need constant input from our senses to carry out functions that give us personality and intellect.",

Why are the feet and legs such accurate reflectors of our sentiments? For millions of years, long before humans spoke, our legs and feet reacted to environmental threats (e.g., hot sand, ill- tempered lions) instantaneously, without the need for conscious thought. Our limbic brains made sure that our feet and legs reacted as needed by either ceasing motion, running away, or kicking at a potential threat. This survival regimen, retained from our ancestral heritage, has served us well and continues to do so today. In fact, these age-old reactions are still so hardwired in us that when we are presented with something dangerous or even disagreeable, our feet and legs still react as they did in prehistoric times.",

Stone and clay tablets were used, but they were prone to fracture and were bulky and heavy to transport. Wood suffers from splitting and is susceptible to decay. Wall paintings are static and space is limited. The invention of paper, said to be one of the four great inventions of the Chinese, solved these problems, but it wasn't until the Romans replaced the scroll with the codex — or, as we call it now, the book — that the material reached its full potential. That was two thousand years ago, and it is still a dominant form of the written word. That paper, a much softer material than either stone or wood, won out as the guardian of the written word is a remarkable materials story.",

No matter how we might state it in shorthand, it is, analytically, a complex interaction of many ideas and implications. The reason must be broken down into a chain of more precise premises. For example, the claim that 'university education should be free for all Australians' might be supported by the reason that 'the economy benefits from a welleducated Australian population'. But is our analysis of the situation clearly expressed in just one statement? Hardly. The conclusion is about universities and free education, while the reason introduces some new ideas: economic benefit and a well-educated population. While the link between these two ideas and the conclusion might seem obvious, the purpose of reasoning is to avoid assuming the 'obvious' by carefully working through the connections between the various ideas in the initial statement of our reason.",

For example, migrants are assumed to overcrowd cities, clog up labor markets, and increase poverty. The other questionable assumption is that most migration is involuntary—people fleeing natural or man-made disasters. The reality, however, is more complex, and many migrants are simply seeking greater economic opportunity. Of course migration can and does create social and economic problems. But migration can also be a solution for many preexisting problems. For example, out-migration generally redistributes workers from places of labor surplus to areas where there is greater demand or more opportunity. Migration is generally selective of persons who are younger, healthier, more flexible, and more willing to endure hardship in hopes of a better life relative to their prospects in their places of origin. Most research that examines longterm outcomes of migration, including remittances and intergenerational mobility, finds positive \"long-term\" effects on places of origin and destination.",

            "text": "The big problem with money created by the government is that those who run the government always face the temptation to create more money and spend it. Whether among ancient kings or modern politicians, this has happened again and again over the centuries, leading to inflation and the many economic and social problems that follow from inflation. For this reason, many countries have preferred using gold, silver, or some other material that is inherently limited in supply, as money. It is a way of depriving governments of the power to expand the money supply to inflationary levels. Gold has long been considered ideal for this purpose, since the supply of gold in the world usually cannot be increased rapidly. When paper money is convertible into gold whenever the individual chooses to do so, then the money is said to be \"backed up\" by gold. This expression is misleading only if we imagine that the value of the gold is somehow transferred to the paper money, when in fact the real point is that the gold simply limits the amount of paper money that can be issued.",

One important stream of the literature examines people with brain damage and how damage to particular parts of the brain known to be responsible for particular cognitive functions impacts on decision making. One example of this research is the work of Antonio Damasio, who finds that when the emotional part of the brain is damaged, this actually reduces the efficacy of decision making. Good decisions are a product of the emotional part of the brain working in conjunction with the deliberative part. This contradicts the assumptions of conventional economics, where emotions play a negative role in the decision-making process. Here it is assumed that decision making can be modeled as being generated in a stoic, unemotional fashion, and that's why decisions tend to be optimal. But the evidence suggests that emotions actually play an important and, often, a positive role in decision making.",

For millions of years this was a highly rational and effective strategy because the light on a dark beach represented the reflection of the moon and stars on the water's surface. Following the lights led baby turtles back home to the sea. The problems started when humans began building beachfront homes and sparkling hotels on the other side of the beach. Now after hatching, turtles heading for the brightest nearby lights were being guided straight into traffic. Are self- destructive sea turtles naturally irrational? Yes, in the modern world. But there's a deeper truth. Turtles are basing their decisions on simple cues that were perfectly rational for their ancestors; these days, however, their evolved decision-making mechanisms are being blinded by modern lights.",

For instance, an exposed brain would neither sense light shining on it nor feel something touching it. In fact, patients are often kept awake during brain surgery, which can help a surgeon isolate specific regions of the brain. The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle recognized this characteristic of the brain over 2,000 years ago when he said, \"Nothing is in the mind that does not pass through the senses.\" This concept can be seen clearly when volunteers are blind-folded and placed in the warm water of a sensory deprivation tank. They soon experience visual, auditory, and tactile (touch) hallucinations, as well as incoherent thought patterns. From these experiments and others, it is apparent that we need constant input from our senses to carry out functions that give us personality and intellect.",

Stone and clay tablets were used, but they were prone to fracture and were bulky and heavy to transport. Wood suffers from splitting and is susceptible to decay. Wall paintings are static and space is limited. The invention of paper, said to be one of the four great inventions of the Chinese, solved these problems, but it wasn't until the Romans replaced the scroll with the codex — or, as we call it now, the book — that the material reached its full potential. That was two thousand years ago, and it is still a dominant form of the written word. That paper, a much softer material than either stone or wood, won out as the guardian of the written word is a remarkable materials story.",

No matter how we might state it in shorthand, it is, analytically, a complex interaction of many ideas and implications. The reason must be broken down into a chain of more precise premises. For example, the claim that 'university education should be free for all Australians' might be supported by the reason that 'the economy benefits from a welleducated Australian population'. But is our analysis of the situation clearly expressed in just one statement? Hardly. The conclusion is about universities and free education, while the reason introduces some new ideas: economic benefit and a well-educated population. While the link between these two ideas and the conclusion might seem obvious, the purpose of reasoning is to avoid assuming the 'obvious' by carefully working through the connections between the various ideas in the initial statement of our reason.",

For example, migrants are assumed to overcrowd cities, clog up labor markets, and increase poverty. The other questionable assumption is that most migration is involuntary—people fleeing natural or man-made disasters. The reality, however, is more complex, and many migrants are simply seeking greater economic opportunity. Of course migration can and does create social and economic problems. But migration can also be a solution for many preexisting problems. For example, out-migration generally redistributes workers from places of labor surplus to areas where there is greater demand or more opportunity. Migration is generally selective of persons who are younger, healthier, more flexible, and more willing to endure hardship in hopes of a better life relative to their prospects in their places of origin. Most research that examines longterm outcomes of migration, including remittances and intergenerational mobility, finds positive \"long-term\" effects on places of origin and destination.",

Whether among ancient kings or modern politicians, this has happened again and again over the centuries, leading to inflation and the many economic and social problems that follow from inflation. For this reason, many countries have preferred using gold, silver, or some other material that is inherently limited in supply, as money. It is a way of depriving governments of the power to expand the money supply to inflationary levels. Gold has long been considered ideal for this purpose, since the supply of gold in the world usually cannot be increased rapidly. When paper money is convertible into gold whenever the individual chooses to do so, then the money is said to be \"backed up\" by gold. This expression is misleading only if we imagine that the value of the gold is somehow transferred to the paper money, when in fact the real point is that the gold simply limits the amount of paper money that can be issued.",

One important stream of the literature examines people with brain damage and how damage to particular parts of the brain known to be responsible for particular cognitive functions impacts on decision making. One example of this research is the work of Antonio Damasio, who finds that when the emotional part of the brain is damaged, this actually reduces the efficacy of decision making. Good decisions are a product of the emotional part of the brain working in conjunction with the deliberative part. This contradicts the assumptions of conventional economics, where emotions play a negative role in the decision-making process. Here it is assumed that decision making can be modeled as being generated in a stoic, unemotional fashion, and that's why decisions tend to be optimal. But the evidence suggests that emotions actually play an important and, often, a positive role in decision making.",

            "text": "Turtle hatchlings have, it seems, evolved to crawl toward the light. For millions of years this was a highly rational and effective strategy because the light on a dark beach represented the reflection of the moon and stars on the water's surface. Following the lights led baby turtles back home to the sea. The problems started when humans began building beachfront homes and sparkling hotels on the other side of the beach. Now after hatching, turtles heading for the brightest nearby lights were being guided straight into traffic. Are self- destructive sea turtles naturally irrational? Yes, in the modern world. But there's a deeper truth. Turtles are basing their decisions on simple cues that were perfectly rational for their ancestors; these days, however, their evolved decision-making mechanisms are being blinded by modern lights.",

For instance, an exposed brain would neither sense light shining on it nor feel something touching it. In fact, patients are often kept awake during brain surgery, which can help a surgeon isolate specific regions of the brain. The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle recognized this characteristic of the brain over 2,000 years ago when he said, \"Nothing is in the mind that does not pass through the senses.\" This concept can be seen clearly when volunteers are blind-folded and placed in the warm water of a sensory deprivation tank. They soon experience visual, auditory, and tactile (touch) hallucinations, as well as incoherent thought patterns. From these experiments and others, it is apparent that we need constant input from our senses to carry out functions that give us personality and intellect.",

This survival regimen, retained from our ancestral heritage, has served us well and continues to do so today.

Stone and clay tablets were used, but they were prone to fracture and were bulky and heavy to transport. Wood suffers from splitting and is susceptible to decay. Wall paintings are static and space is limited. The invention of paper, said to be one of the four great inventions of the Chinese, solved these problems, but it wasn't until the Romans replaced the scroll with the codex — or, as we call it now, the book — that the material reached its full potential. That was two thousand years ago, and it is still a dominant form of the written word. That paper, a much softer material than either stone or wood, won out as the guardian of the written word is a remarkable materials story.",

No matter how we might state it in shorthand, it is, analytically, a complex interaction of many ideas and implications. The reason must be broken down into a chain of more precise premises. For example, the claim that 'university education should be free for all Australians' might be supported by the reason that 'the economy benefits from a well-educated Australian population'. But is our analysis of the situation clearly expressed in just one statement? Hardly. The conclusion is about universities and free education, while the reason introduces some new ideas: economic benefit and a well-educated population. While the link between these two ideas and the conclusion might seem obvious, the purpose of reasoning is to avoid assuming the 'obvious' by carefully working through the connections between the various ideas in the initial statement of our reason.",

For example, migrants are assumed to overcrowd cities, clog up labor markets, and increase poverty. The other questionable assumption is that most migration is involuntary—people fleeing natural or man-made disasters. The reality, however, is more complex, and many migrants are simply seeking greater economic opportunity. Of course migration can and does create social and economic problems. But migration can also be a solution for many preexisting problems. For example, out-migration generally redistributes workers from places of labor surplus to areas where there is greater demand or more opportunity. Migration is generally selective of persons who are younger, healthier, more flexible, and more willing to endure hardship in hopes of a better life relative to their prospects in their places of origin. Most research that examines long-term outcomes of migration, including remittances and intergenerational mobility, finds positive \"long-term\" effects on places of origin and destination.",

Whether among ancient kings or modern politicians, this has happened again and again over the centuries, leading to inflation and the many economic and social problems that follow from inflation. For this reason, many countries have preferred using gold, silver, or some other material that is inherently limited in supply, as money. It is a way of depriving governments of the power to expand the money supply to inflationary levels. Gold has long been considered ideal for this purpose, since the supply of gold in the world usually cannot be increased rapidly. When paper money is convertible into gold whenever the individual chooses to do so, then the money is said to be \"backed up\" by gold. This expression is misleading only if we imagine that the value of the gold is somehow transferred to the paper money, when in fact the real point is that the gold simply limits the amount of paper money that can be issued.",

One important stream of the literature examines people with brain damage and how damage to particular parts of the brain known to be responsible for particular cognitive functions impacts on decision making. One example of this research is the work of Antonio Damasio, who finds that when the emotional part of the brain is damaged, this actually reduces the efficacy of decision making. Good decisions are a product of the emotional part of the brain working in conjunction with the deliberative part. This contradicts the assumptions of conventional economics, where emotions play a negative role in the decision-making process. Here it is assumed that decision making can be modeled as being generated in a stoic, unemotional fashion, and that's why decisions tend to be optimal. But the evidence suggests that emotions actually play an important and, often, a positive role in decision making.",

In fact, patients are often kept awake during brain surgery, which can help a surgeon isolate specific regions of the brain. The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle recognized this characteristic of the brain over 2,000 years ago when he said, \"Nothing is in the mind that does not pass through the senses.\" This concept can be seen clearly when volunteers are blind-folded and placed in the warm water of a sensory deprivation tank. They soon experience visual, auditory, and tactile (touch) hallucinations, as well as incoherent thought patterns.

For example, the claim that 'university education should be free for all Australians' might be supported by the reason that 'the economy benefits from a well-educated Australian population'. But is our analysis of the situation clearly expressed in just one statement? Hardly. The conclusion is about universities and free education, while the reason introduces some new ideas: economic benefit and a well-educated population. While the link between these two ideas and the conclusion might seem obvious, the purpose of reasoning is to avoid assuming the 'obvious' by carefully working through the connections between the various ideas in the initial statement of our reason.",

For example, migrants are assumed to overcrowd cities, clog up labor markets, and increase poverty. The other questionable assumption is that <u>most migration is involuntary</u>—people fleeing natural or man-made disasters. The reality, however, is more complex, and many migrants are simply seeking greater economic opportunity. Of course migration can and does create social and economic problems. But migration can also be a solution for many preexisting problems. For example, out-migration generally redistributes workers from places of labor surplus to areas where there is greater demand or more opportunity. Migration is generally selective of persons who are younger, healthier, more flexible, and more willing to endure hardship in hopes of a better life relative to their prospects in their places of origin. Most research that examines long-term outcomes of migration, including remittances and intergenerational mobility, finds positive \"long-term\" effects on places of origin and destination.",

            "text": "The big problem with money created by the government is that those who run the government always face the temptation to create more money and spend it. Whether among ancient kings or modern politicians, this has happened again and again over the centuries, leading to inflation and the many economic and social problems that follow from inflation. For this reason, many countries have preferred using gold, silver, or some other material that is inherently limited in supply, as money. It is a way of depriving governments of the power to expand the money supply to inflationary levels. Gold has long been considered ideal for this purpose, since the supply of gold in the world usually cannot be increased rapidly. When paper money is convertible into gold whenever the individual chooses to do so, then the money is said to be <u>backed up</u> by gold. This expression is misleading only if we imagine that the value of the gold is somehow transferred to the paper money, when in fact the real point is that the gold simply limits the amount of paper money that can be issued.",

One important stream of the literature examines people with brain damage and how damage to particular parts of the brain known to be responsible for particular cognitive functions impacts on decision making. One example of this research is the work of Antonio Damasio, who finds that when the emotional part of the brain is damaged, this actually reduces the efficacy of decision making. Good decisions are a product of the emotional part of the brain working in conjunction with the deliberative part. <u>This contradicts the assumptions of conventional economics, where emotions play a negative role in the decision-making process</u>. Here it is assumed that decision making can be modeled as being generated in a stoic, unemotional fashion, and that's why decisions tend to be optimal. But the evidence suggests that emotions actually play an important and, often, a positive role in decision making.",

For millions of years this was a highly rational and effective strategy because the light on a dark beach represented the reflection of the moon and stars on the water's surface. Following the lights led baby turtles back home to the sea. The problems started when humans began building beachfront homes and sparkling hotels on the other side of the beach. Now after hatching, turtles heading for the brightest nearby lights were being guided straight into traffic. Are self- destructive sea turtles naturally irrational? Yes, in the modern world. But there's a deeper truth. Turtles are basing their decisions on simple cues that were perfectly rational for their ancestors; these days, however, their evolved decision-making mechanisms are being blinded by modern lights.",

For instance, an exposed brain would neither sense light shining on it nor feel something touching it. In fact, patients are often kept awake during brain surgery, which can help a surgeon isolate specific regions of the brain. The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle recognized this characteristic of the brain over 2,000 years ago when he said, \"Nothing is in the mind that does not pass through the senses.\" This concept can be seen clearly when volunteers are blind-folded and placed in the warm water of a sensory deprivation tank. They soon experience visual, auditory, and tactile (touch) hallucinations, as well as incoherent thought patterns. From these experiments and others, it is apparent that we need constant input from our senses to carry out functions that give us personality and intellect.",

Why are the feet and legs such accurate reflectors of our sentiments? For millions of years, long before humans spoke, our legs and feet reacted to environmental threats (e.g., hot sand, ill- tempered lions) instantaneously, without the need for conscious thought. Our limbic brains made sure that our feet and legs reacted as needed by either ceasing motion, running away, or kicking at a potential threat. This survival regimen, retained from our ancestral heritage, has served us well and continues to do so today. In fact, these age-old reactions are still so hardwired in us that when we are presented with something dangerous or even disagreeable, our feet and legs still react as they did in prehistoric times.",

Stone and clay tablets were used, but they were prone to fracture and were bulky and heavy to transport. Wood suffers from splitting and is susceptible to decay. Wall paintings are static and space is limited. The invention of paper, said to be one of the four great inventions of the Chinese, solved these problems, but it wasn't until the Romans replaced the scroll with the codex — or, as we call it now, the book — that the material reached its full potential. That was two thousand years ago, and it is still a dominant form of the written word. That paper, a much softer material than either stone or wood, won out as the guardian of the written word is a remarkable materials story.",

No matter how we might state it in shorthand, it is, analytically, a complex interaction of many ideas and implications. The reason must be broken down into a chain of more precise premises. For example, the claim that 'university education should be free for all Australians' might be supported by the reason that 'the economy benefits from a welleducated Australian population'. But is our analysis of the situation clearly expressed in just one statement? Hardly. The conclusion is about universities and free education, while the reason introduces some new ideas: economic benefit and a well-educated population. While the link between these two ideas and the conclusion might seem obvious, the purpose of reasoning is to avoid assuming the 'obvious' by carefully working through the connections between the various ideas in the initial statement of our reason.",

For example, migrants are assumed to overcrowd cities, clog up labor markets, and increase poverty. The other questionable assumption is that most migration is involuntary—people fleeing natural or man-made disasters. The reality, however, is more complex, and many migrants are simply seeking greater economic opportunity. Of course migration can and does create social and economic problems. But migration can also be a solution for many preexisting problems. For example, out-migration generally redistributes workers from places of labor surplus to areas where there is greater demand or more opportunity. Migration is generally selective of persons who are younger, healthier, more flexible, and more willing to endure hardship in hopes of a better life relative to their prospects in their places of origin. Most research that examines long-term outcomes of migration, including remittances and intergenerational mobility, finds positive \"long-term\" effects on places of origin and destination.",

Whether among ancient kings or modern politicians, this has happened again and again over the centuries, leading to inflation and the many economic and social problems that follow from inflation. For this reason, many countries have preferred using gold, silver, or some other material that is inherently limited in supply, as money. It is a way of depriving governments of the power to expand the money supply to inflationary levels. Gold has long been considered ideal for this purpose, since the supply of gold in the world usually cannot be increased rapidly. When paper money is convertible into gold whenever the individual chooses to do so, then the money is said to be \"backed up\" by gold. This expression is misleading only if we imagine that the value of the gold is somehow transferred to the paper money, when in fact the real point is that the gold simply limits the amount of paper money that can be issued.",

            "text": "The study of emotions and decision making is now of considerable importance. This involves the application of various tools afforded by neuroscience. One important stream of the literature examines people with brain damage and how damage to particular parts of the brain known to be responsible for particular cognitive functions impacts on decision making. One example of this research is the work of Antonio Damasio, who finds that when the emotional part of the brain is damaged, this actually reduces the efficacy of decision making. Good decisions are a product of the emotional part of the brain working in conjunction with the deliberative part. This contradicts the assumptions of conventional economics, where emotions play a negative role in the decision-making process. Here it is assumed that decision making can be modeled as being generated in a stoic, unemotional fashion, and that's why decisions tend to be optimal. But the evidence suggests that emotions actually play an important and, often, a positive role in decision making.",

For millions of years this was a highly rational and effective strategy because the light on a dark beach represented the reflection of the moon and stars on the water's surface. Following the lights led baby turtles back home to the sea. The problems started when humans began building beachfront homes and sparkling hotels on the other side of the beach. Now after hatching, turtles __________ straight into traffic. Are selfdestructive sea turtles naturally irrational? Yes, in the modern world. But there's a deeper truth. Turtles are basing their decisions on simple cues that were perfectly rational for their ancestors; these days, however, their evolved decision-making mechanisms are being blinded by modern lights",

For instance, an exposed brain would neither sense light shining on it nor feel something touching it. In fact, patients are often kept awake during brain surgery, which can help a surgeon isolate specific regions of the brain. The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle recognized this characteristic of the brain over 2,000 years ago when he said, \"Nothing is in the mind __________.\" This concept can be seen clearly when volunteers are blind -folded and placed in the warm water of a sensory deprivation tank. They soon experience visual, auditory, and tactile (touch) hallucinations, as well as incoherent thought patterns. From these experiments and others, it is apparent that we need constant input from our senses to carry out functions that give us personality and intellect",

Stone and clay tablets were used, but they were prone to fracture and were bulky and heavy to transport. Wood suffers from splitting and is susceptible to decay. Wall paintings are static and space is limited. The invention of paper, said to be one of the four great inventions of the Chinese, solved these problems, but it wasn't until the Romans replaced the scroll with the codex — or, __________ — that the material reached its full potential. That was two thousand years ago, and it is still a dominant form of the written word. That paper, a much softer material than either stone or wood, won out as the guardian of the written word is a remarkable materials story",

The reason must be broken down into a chain of more precise premises. For example, the claim that 'university education should be free for all Australians' might be supported by the reason that 'the economy benefits from a well-educated Australian population'. But is our analysis of the situation clearly expressed in just one statement? Hardly. The conclusion is about universities and free education, while the reason introduces some new ideas: economic benefit and a well-educated population. While the link between these two ideas and the conclusion might seem obvious, the purpose of reasoning is to avoid assuming the 'obvious' by carefully working through the connections between the various ideas in the initial statement of our reason",

For example, migrants are assumed to overcrowd cities, clog up labor markets, and increase poverty. The other questionable assumption is that most migration is involuntary—people fleeing natural or man-made disasters. The reality, however, is more complex, and many migrants are simply seeking greater economic opportunity. Of course migration can and does create social and economic problems. But migration can also be a solution for many preexisting problems. For example, out-migration generally redistributes workers from places of labor surplus to areas where _________. Migration is generally selective of persons who are younger, healthier, more flexible, and more willing to endure hardship in hopes of a better life relative to their prospects in their places of origin. Most research that examines long-term outcomes of migration, including remittances and intergenerational mobility, finds positive \"long-term\" effects on places of origin and destination",

Whether among ancient kings or modern politicians, this has happened again and again over the centuries, leading to inflation and the many economic and social problems that follow from inflation. For this reason, many countries have preferred using gold, silver, or some other material that is inherently limited in supply, as money. It is __________ to expand the money supply to inflationary levels. Gold has long been considered ideal for this purpose, since the supply of gold in the world usually cannot be increased rapidly. When paper money is convertible into gold whenever the individual chooses to do so, then the money is said to be \"backed up\" by gold. This expression is misleading only if we imagine that the value of the gold is somehow transferred to the paper money, when in fact the real point is that the gold simply limits the amount of paper money that can be issued",

One important stream of the literature examines people with brain damage and how damage to particular parts of the brain known to be responsible for particular cognitive functions impacts on decision making. One example of this research is the work of Antonio Damasio, who finds that when the emotional part of the brain is damaged, this actually reduces the efficacy of decision making. Good decisions are a product of the emotional part of the brain working in conjunction with the deliberative part. This contradicts the assumptions of conventional economics, where emotions play a negative role in the decision-making process. Here it is assumed that decision making can be modeled as being generated in a stoic, unemotional fashion, and that's why decisions tend to be optimal. But the evidence suggests that emotions actually play an important and, often, a positive role in decision making.",

(2)번 문장은 중국인들이 종이를 개발하기 전에 대나무 조 각을 사용했다는 세부적인 역사적 사실을 언급하고 있는데, 이는 글의 주요 흐름인 쓰기 재료의 발전과 종이의 우수성 에 대한 전체적인 논의와 직접적인 관련이 없다.\n67) 정답: (3)\n\n해설: 이 글은 결론을 뒷받침하는 이유는 단일 주장으로 구성 되기 어렵고, 여러 아이디어와 함의의 복잡한 상호작용으로 이루어진다는 점을 설명하고 있다. 글의 흐름은 이유를 더 정확한 전제들의 연결고리로 분석해야 한다는 주장을 전개 하고 있다. 그러나 (3)번 문장은 유럽 국가들의 무료 대학 교육 시행에 관한 내용으로, 글의 주제인 '논증 분석 방법' 과는 관련이 있을 수 있지만 전체적인 논리 전개와는 무관 하다. 다른 문장들은 모두 논증 분석의 필요성과 방법에 관 한 일관된 설명을 제공하고 있다.\n68) 정답: (2)\n\n해설: 이 글은 이주(migration)가 문제나 위기로 인식되는 경 향이 있지만, 실제로는 많은 기존 문제들에 대한 해결책이 될 수 있다는 긍정적인 측면을 강조하고 있다. 글의 전체적 인 흐름은 이주의 긍정적 효과(노동력 재분배, 젊고 건강한 인력 이동, 장기적 긍정 효과)를 설명하는 데 초점이 맞춰 져 있다. 그러나 (2)번 문장은 국가들이 이민자 유입을 제한 하기 위해 엄격한 국경 통제 정책을 시행했다는 내용으로,",

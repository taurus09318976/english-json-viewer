When we feel this bear-like urge to carve out restorative time to \"hibernate,\" we should think of it as the sensible impulse of <u>our inner bear</u>. We might consider withdrawing from some social activities to take stock of our lives, start a creative project, plan a trip, or plant seeds of thought that will hopefully spring up and come to fruition in the future. However, we also need to remember that bears come out of their dens once spring arrives. Spending too much time in isolation can deprive us of connection with and inspiration from the outside world.

For example, if we believe that human population growth is a problem, then conscious decisions to reduce human population growth reflect a value decision that we as a society choose to endorse and implement. As another example, consider flooding of small urban streams. Flooding is a hazard experienced by many communities. The study of rivers and their natural processes leads to a number of potential solutions for a given flood hazard. We may choose to place the stream in a concrete box — a remedy that can significantly reduce the flood hazard. Alternatively, we may choose to restore our urban streams and their floodplains, the flat land adjacent to the river that periodically floods, as greenbelts. This choice will reduce damage from flooding while providing habitat for a variety of animals including raccoons, foxes, beavers, and muskrats that use the stream environment; resident and migratory birds that nest, feed, and rest close to a river; and a variety of fish that live in the river system. We will also be more comfortable when interacting with the river. That is why <u>river parks</u> are so popular.",

However, recent changes in volunteer schedule management are proving increasingly challenging for me and many others to sustain our commitment. Previously, volunteers were asked to sign up for available slots on the schedule. This worked very well for all of us because it allowed the flexibility to fit our volunteer time with various other demands on our time. In the last six weeks, though, the new manager of volunteer services has begun assigning us to volunteer schedules without consulting us, causing a great deal of upset among the volunteers and resulting in numerous cancellations of shifts. As unpaid volunteers, we value our autonomy and should not be treated like salaried employees whose working hours can be assigned by management. I hope you can address this problem before it becomes too great to solve. Sincerely,\n\nKate Greenbaum",

            "text": "Good intuition is the first requirement for designing meaningful ecological studies. The best way to develop that intuition is by observing organisms in the field. Sadly, few of us \"have the time\" to just observe nature. Graduate committees and tenure reviewers are not likely to recommend investing precious time in this way. However, observations are absolutely essential for generating working hypotheses grounded in reality. So, carve out some time to get to know your organisms. If you are too busy with classes and other responsibilities, reserve two days before starting your experiments to observe your ecological system with no manipulations (or preconceived notions). It's often fun to do this with a lab mate or colleague. The opposite can work well too: consider spending a whole day with no other people or distractions around, just looking at your system.",

As the planet warms, high latitudes will warm faster than the tropics, the Mediterranean will become drier, and the tropics will be wetter. But this is like saying you should carry an umbrella in Spain because it is going to rain in Vietnam. To plan for and adapt effectively to climate change, we need information about the future climate at much finer scales than general circulation models (GCMs) can provide. Decisions about whether to put up a dike, move houses, switch crops, or buy insurance require data at scales of less than 100 kilometers. One approach is to embed a finer-scale model of a particular area of interest into a larger-scale GCM. No region is isolated from the rest of the planet, so the GCM part of the model can track global dynamics and exchange information with the finer-scale regional climate model.",

However, we also need to remember that bears come out of their dens once spring arrives. Spending too much time in isolation can deprive us of connection with and inspiration from the outside world.

While we can (and do) dismiss the moral importance of plant experiences, to pretend that they don't exist is a very dangerous form of disregard. Our cold, utilitarian approach to reducing climate change has so far been largely ineffectual. To bring real change, we need to learn to see plants as independent, intrinsically valuable, sentient beings — not mere tools for our own human flourishing. Our welfare is deeply dependent upon the welfare of plants, and the best way for us to make sense of this is by reminding ourselves that they are persons. They have just as much of a right to clean water, healthy soil, and a liveable atmosphere as the rest of us, and this needs to be remembered when we consider the ethical dimensions of climate change.",

In fact, global sports spread more like the bubonic plague than the burrito. They are global phenomena that emerged almost exclusively from Western civilization — from European nations and European settler societies — and spread to other parts of the world. Take, for instance, soccer (association football). Before European contact, ball games that limited or barred the use of the hands flourished in Mesoamerica. Today, fútbol ignites the passions of millions of Mexicans. Estadio Azteca has been filled to overflowing for two World Cup finals (1970 and 1986) and a multitude of other international matches. You might easily conclude that fútbol fused Mesoamerican and European sporting pastimes, much like pizza and pasta fused Old World and New World food. It did not.",

Television news, for example, allows for a vivid and dramatic presentation of a story, but may be less suitable than a newspaper or magazine for lengthy and probing analysis. Social networking sites make it easier for us to stay connected to our friends, but make it more difficult to maintain our privacy (especially from advertisers). Caller identification, which is standard on most mobile phones, makes it easier for us to screen our calls, but it also makes it easier for calls that we make to be screened by others. Often the constraints of new technologies are less visible to us than their affordances.

            "text": "When given many chances, chance will tend to distribute random differences fairly equally. However, when given few chances, it may distribute random differences very unequally. Thus, if you assigned each individual to a group by flipping a coin and you had many participants, chance would do a good job of making your groups equivalent. Conversely, if you had few participants, chance would probably do a poor job of balancing the effects of individual differences between groups. Indeed, with too few participants, chance has no chance. For example, if you had four people in your study and only one of those was violent, flipping a coin could not give you equal groups. Even if you had eight participants, four of whom were violent, flipping a coin might result in all four violent individuals ending up in the same group. Why? Because, in the short run, chance can be unpredictable. For instance, it is not that unusual to get four \"heads\" in a row. To appreciate that chance can be unpredictable in the short run but dependable in the long run, realize that although a casino may lose several bets in a row, the casino always wins in the end.",

The best-analyzed example involves monkeys' fear of snakes. Monkeys reared in captivity do not exhibit fear the first time they encounter live or toy snakes. If they watch another monkey behaving fearfully toward a snake, they later do the same themselves. During the learning trial the naive observer exhibits behavior like the model's (in this case responses such as withdrawal, vocalization, and piloerection). If naive monkeys observe a model behaving fearfully toward a snake and neutrally toward another object like a flower, they acquire the same discrimination. For example, if they are later offered raisins that are out of reach beyond a flower or a snake, they reach quickly over the flower but refuse to reach over the snake.",

He forced himself to learn, review, and recall nonsense words on a specific, timed schedule. What Ebbinghaus discovered was that the rate of forgetting was predictable. He discovered a pattern of exactly how long it took to forget. If he reminded himself of one of his nonsense words just before he knew he was about to forget it — but no sooner — he could save himself hours of studying but still recall the information correctly. The trick was knowing when he was about to forget it. Ebbinghaus's memorization technique became known as spaced repetition. Essentially, it was the most highly specific, scientifically based study schedule you could dream of. Over a hundred years later, specially designed computer programs made following a modified version of Ebbinghaus's schedules feasible.",

            "text": "Linguist Philip Lieberman argues that human ancestors (e.g., Homo erectus) had the ability to speak, although their speech would not have been as refined as modern humans' speech. This conclusion is based on reasoning about why the human vocal tract has the shape it does. Lieberman notes that to produce vowel sounds such as /i/ (as in meet) and /u/ (as in you), the space above the larynx in the throat has to be about the same length as the horizontal space between the top of the throat and the mouth opening. For natural selection to produce and maintain this arrangement, Lieberman argues, some basic speech abilities must have been present beforehand. Natural selection could then have favored individuals who had physical characteristics that allowed them to produce a wider range of vowel sounds. Unless some basic speech abilities were present prior to the appearance of Homo sapiens, a lowered larynx, and the accompanying ability to produce more vowel sounds, would have to be the result of a massive and incredibly lucky mutation, rather than gradual evolution by natural selection.",

Philosophers have been particularly vexed by this question and have developed a range of possible answers to it. On the one hand, the meaning of a concept seems to derive from the meaning of other concepts, as when a child is told the meaning of sprint by saying it is a kind of fast running. On the other hand, the meaning of a concept is connected to observations of things in the world, as when the child actually sees someone sprinting. A concept's meaning is normally not given by definition in terms of other concepts, since successful exact definitions are rare. Nor is meaning exhausted by a set of examples, as if one identified the concept of dog with a set of dogs. A theory of meaning of the concepts must therefore include an account of how concepts are related both to each other and to the world. Both aspects are necessary in order for us to understand how concepts underlie our ability to use language.",

Sometimes, however, potential parties to a verbal exchange find themselves sharing little more than physical proximity to one another. Such situations arise when members of communities with radically different language traditions and no history of previous contact with one another come face to face and are forced to communicate. There is no way to predict the outcome of such enforced contact on either speech community, yet from these new shared experiences, new forms of practice, including a new form of language — pidgin — may develop.",

But humans are still responsible for forming hypotheses, designing experiments, and drawing conclusions. What if a machine could be responsible for the entire scientific process — formulating a hypothesis, designing and running the experiment, analyzing data, and deciding which experiment to run next — all without human intervention? The idea may sound like a plot from a futuristic sci-fi novel, but that sci-fi scenario has, in fact, already happened.

As another example, consider flooding of small urban streams. Flooding is a hazard experienced by many communities. The study of rivers and their natural processes leads to a number of potential solutions for a given flood hazard. We may choose to place the stream in a concrete box ― a remedy that can significantly reduce the flood hazard. Alternatively, we may choose to restore our urban streams and their floodplains, the flat land adjacent to the river that periodically floods, as greenbelts. This choice will reduce damage from flooding while providing habitat for a variety of animals including raccoons, foxes, beavers, and muskrats that use the stream environment; resident and migratory birds that nest, feed, and rest close to a river; and a variety of fish that live in the river system. We will also be more comfortable when interacting with the river. That is why river parks are so popular.",

Early farmers had to toil as hard as if not harder than hunter-gatherers, and for the last few thousand years farmers primarily exercised, often through sports, to prepare for fighting. Ancient texts like The Iliad, paintings from pharaonic Egypt, and Mesopotamian carvings testify that sports like wrestling, sprinting, and javelin throwing helped would-be warriors keep fit and hone combat skills. But not all exercise in the ancient world was combat related. If you were wealthy enough to attend one of the great Athenian schools of philosophy, you would have been advised to exercise as part of your physical education. Philosophers like Plato, Socrates, and Zeno of Citium preached that to live the best possible life, one should exercise not only one's mind but also one's body. This idea is not just Western. Confucius and other prominent Chinese philosophers also taught that exercise was equally essential for physical and mental health and encouraged regular gymnastics and martial arts.",

Let us leave aside the realm of science fiction, where time travelers are able actually to experience the future \"before it happens,\" and concentrate on those visions in which the future is somehow knowable because it is connected to the past and the present. Some scholars see time in much the same way as biologists see living organisms. If biologists know the genetic material of an organism and the conditions in which it lives (its nutrition, for example), and they know the laws that govern its development, they can predict how the mature organism will look and behave. In much the same way, some scholars argue, the future somehow \"grows\" out of conditions in the past and the present. There is a direct and almost physical connection between past and future. If one perceives the present and the past correctly, and if one also knows the laws that govern development or growth, then one can forecast fairly accurately what the future will be like.",

After many years in which theoretical models of health behavior — and intervention efforts based on these models — emphasized knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, and self-efficacy, emotions are increasingly recognized as playing a crucial role. However, attempts to add an emotional component to behavior change interventions have focused almost exclusively on fear. Public service announcements (PSAs) promoting behavior change (e.g., smoking cessation, healthy diet) routinely present frightening facts and images in an effort to scare the viewer into adopting a healthier lifestyle. Although fear appeals are highly memorable, they are effective in promoting behavior change only if they also boost self-efficacy so viewers believe they are able to do whatever is needed to avoid the dangerous outcome; otherwise, they simply tune out the message. Because a typical viewer has already tried several times to make the change in question and failed, this is a substantial challenge.",

            "text": "Education has always emphasized rules and logical thinking. Step-by-step learning proceeds in a predetermined direction (vertical thinking). Researchers have viewed creativity as a mysterious ability that can be fostered but not taught. Psychological studies have found that the natural creativity of children often declines after a couple of years in school.\nAccording to a psychologist Edward de Bono, creativity requires the restructuring of deep-rooted patterns. The ability, whether innate or developed, to go beyond the limitations of previous patterns is integral to that process. Lateral thinking is needed, the fundamental principle of which is that any particular point of view is but one of many possibilities. There are just as many descriptions of a phenomenon as there are perspectives. Lateral thinking seeks alternative patterns instead of simply building on existing models.\nVertical thinking is a gradually increasing process, whereas lateral thinking permits significant leaps. The individual steps involved in lateral thinking need not be correct as long as the ultimate conclusion solves the problem. Instead of constantly evaluating and accepting that which appears to be correct at the moment, an assessment is postponed. Once a certain point has been reached, it is often possible to retrace a logical path to the starting point. Once that has been accomplished, the direction and order of the various steps are unlikely to matter very much. Lateral thinking is like building a vault or a bridge with scaffolding that is torn down once construction has been completed. The various parts of the bridge do not have to stand on their own during each phase of the project. But once the keystone has been laid, the entire structure must be self-supporting.",

However, recent changes in volunteer schedule management are proving increasingly challenging for me and many others to sustain our commitment. Previously, volunteers were asked to sign up for available slots on the schedule. This worked very well for all of us because it allowed the flexibility to fit our volunteer time with various other demands on our time. In the last six weeks, though, the new manager of volunteer services has begun assigning us to volunteer schedules without consulting us, causing a great deal of upset among the volunteers and resulting in numerous cancellations of shifts. As unpaid volunteers, we value our autonomy and should not be treated like salaried employees whose working hours can be assigned by management. I hope you can address this problem before it becomes too great to solve. Sincerely,\n\nKate Greenbaum",

I ran across the house in total darkness, my hands outstretched, blindly feeling for walls and furniture to guide me toward Dustin's bedroom. A violent aftershock knocked me to my knees, but I couldn't stop. I had to get to my son, no matter what. Then, the shaking stopped, and everything became quiet as I peered into my son's bedroom. By now accustomed to the darkness, I could make out that Dustin's bookcases had fallen into the center of the room, narrowly missing his bed. Crawling over the debris, I finally reached Dustin. He was shaking with fear but was huddling safely under the covers. I hugged Dustin tight and breathed a sigh of relief. In that moment, nothing else mattered but the fact that my son was safe.",

Sadly, few of us \"have the time\" to just observe nature. Graduate committees and tenure reviewers are not likely to recommend investing precious time in this way. However, observations are absolutely essential for generating working hypotheses grounded in reality. So, carve out some time to get to know your organisms. If you are too busy with classes and other responsibilities, reserve two days before starting your experiments to observe your ecological system with no manipulations (or preconceived notions). It's often fun to do this with a lab mate or colleague. The opposite can work well too: consider spending a whole day with no other people or distractions around, just looking at your system.",

As the planet warms, high latitudes will warm faster than the tropics, the Mediterranean will become drier, and the tropics will be wetter. But this is like saying you should carry an umbrella in Spain because it is going to rain in Vietnam. To plan for and adapt effectively to climate change, we need information about the future climate at much finer scales than general circulation models (GCMs) can provide. Decisions about whether to put up a dike, move houses, switch crops, or buy insurance require data at scales of less than 100 kilometers. One approach is to embed a finer-scale model of a particular area of interest into a larger-scale GCM. No region is isolated from the rest of the planet, so the GCM part of the model can track global dynamics and exchange information with the finer-scale regional climate model.",

Like the bear, we sometimes feel a need to retreat from the world, particularly after periods of stress. When we feel this bear-like urge to carve out restorative time to \"hibernate,\" we should think of it as the sensible impulse of our inner bear. We might consider withdrawing from some social activities to take stock of our lives, start a creative project, plan a trip, or plant seeds of thought that will hopefully spring up and come to fruition in the future. However, we also need to remember that bears come out of their dens once spring arrives. Spending too much time in isolation can deprive us of connection with and inspiration from the outside world. It's best to balance the urge to retreat for restoration with the opportunity to be revitalized by all that the world has to offer.",

While we can (and do) dismiss the moral importance of plant experiences, to pretend that they don't exist is a very dangerous form of disregard. Our cold, utilitarian approach to reducing climate change has so far been largely ineffectual. To bring real change, we need to learn to see plants as independent, intrinsically valuable, sentient beings - not mere tools for our own human flourishing. Our welfare is deeply dependent upon the welfare of plants, and the best way for us to make sense of this is by reminding ourselves that they are persons. They have just as much of a right to clean water, healthy soil, and a liveable atmosphere as the rest of us, and this needs to be remembered when we consider the ethical dimensions of climate change.",

Take, for instance, soccer (association football). Before European contact, ball games that limited or barred the use of the hands flourished in Mesoamerica. Today, fútbol ignites the passions of millions of Mexicans. Estadio Azteca has been filled to overflowing for two World Cup finals (1970 and 1986) and a multitude of other international matches.

            "text": "Helen Moore Sewell was an American artist and author of children's books who was known for her illustrations. Sewell began drawing at an early age. At the age of 12 , she became the youngest person ever to attend the Pratt Institute, which was especially renowned for art and design. She also studied under the Ukrainian American artist Alexander Archipenko, who dramatically influenced her style. Sewell's early work was as both an author and an illustrator. In 1924, she illustrated her first book, Susanne K. Langer's The Cruise of the Little Dipper, and Other Fairy Tales. She illustrated her own book, ABC for Everyday, in 1930 and a year later collaborated with her younger sister on Building a House in Sweden. She also illustrated classic works, including those by American poet Emily Dickinson and British authors like Jane Austen. During her career, Sewell illustrated more than 50 books. She won a Caldecott Honor in 1955 for her illustrations in The Thanksgiving Story by American author Alice Dalgliesh.",

Television news, for example, allows for a vivid and dramatic presentation of a story, but may be less suitable than a newspaper or magazine for lengthy and probing analysis. Social networking sites make it easier for us to stay connected to our friends, but make it more difficult to maintain our privacy (especially from advertisers). Caller identification, which is standard on most mobile phones, makes it easier for us to screen our calls, but it also makes it easier for calls that we make to be screened by others. Often the constraints of new technologies are less visible to us than their affordances. We tend to be so focused on the new things we can do with a new tool that we don't pay attention to the things we cannot do with it.",

Thus, if you assigned each individual to a group by flipping a coin and you had many participants, chance would do a good job of making your groups equivalent. Conversely, if you had few participants, chance would probably do a poor job of balancing the effects of individual differences between groups. Indeed, with too few participants, chance has no chance. For example, if you had four people in your study and only one of those was violent, flipping a coin could not give you equal groups. Even if you had eight participants, four of whom were violent, flipping a coin might result in all four violent individuals ending up in the same group. Why? Because, in the short run, chance can be unpredictable. For instance, it is not that unusual to get four \"heads\" in a row. To appreciate that chance can be unpredictable in the short run but dependable in the long run, realize that although a casino may lose several bets in a row, the casino always wins in the end.",

The best-analyzed example involves monkeys' fear of snakes. Monkeys reared in captivity do not exhibit fear the first time they encounter live or toy snakes. If they watch another monkey behaving fearfully toward a snake, they later do the same themselves. During the learning trial the naive observer exhibits behavior like the model's (in this case responses such as withdrawal, vocalization, and piloerection). If naive monkeys observe a model behaving fearfully toward a snake and neutrally toward another object like a flower, they acquire the same discrimination. For example, if they are later offered raisins that are out of reach beyond a flower or a snake, they reach quickly over the flower but refuse to reach over the snake.",

He forced himself to learn, review, and recall nonsense words on a specific, timed schedule. What Ebbinghaus discovered was that the rate of forgetting was predictable. He discovered a pattern of exactly how long it took to forget. If he reminded himself of one of his nonsense words just before he knew he was about to forget it — but no sooner — he could save himself hours of studying but still recall the information correctly. The trick was knowing when he was about to forget it. Ebbinghaus's memorization technique became known as spaced repetition. Essentially, it was the most highly specific, scientifically based study schedule you could dream of. Over a hundred years later, specially designed computer programs made following a modified version of Ebbinghaus's schedules feasible.",

This conclusion is based on reasoning about why the human vocal tract has the shape it does. Lieberman notes that to produce vowel sounds such as /i/ (as in meet) and /u/ (as in you), the space above the larynx in the throat has to be about the same length as the horizontal space between the top of the throat and the mouth opening. For natural selection to produce and maintain this arrangement, Lieberman argues, some basic speech abilities must have been present beforehand. Natural selection could then have favored individuals who had physical characteristics that allowed them to produce a wider range of vowel sounds. Unless some basic speech abilities were present prior to the appearance of Homo sapiens, a lowered larynx, and the accompanying ability to produce more vowel sounds, would have to be the result of a massive and incredibly lucky mutation, rather than gradual evolution by natural selection.",

Philosophers have been particularly vexed by this question and have developed a range of possible answers to it. On the one hand, the meaning of a concept seems to derive from the meaning of other concepts, as when a child is told the meaning of sprint by saying it is a kind of fast running. On the other hand, the meaning of a concept is connected to observations of things in the world, as when the child actually sees someone sprinting. A concept's meaning is normally not given by definition in terms of other concepts, since successful exact definitions are rare. Nor is meaning exhausted by a set of examples, as if one identified the concept of dog with a set of dogs. A theory of meaning of the concepts must therefore include an account of how concepts are related both to each other and to the world. Both aspects are necessary in order for us to understand how concepts underlie our ability to use language.",

Such situations arise when members of communities with radically different language traditions and no history of previous contact with one another come face to face and are forced to communicate.

If so, it could drastically accelerate the advancement of science. Indeed, scientists have been relying on robot-driven laboratory instruments to screen for drugs and to sequence genomes. But humans are still responsible for forming hypotheses, designing experiments, and drawing conclusions. What if a machine could be responsible for the entire scientific process — formulating a hypothesis, designing and running the experiment, analyzing data, and deciding which experiment to run next — all without human intervention? The idea may sound like a plot from a futuristic sci-fi novel, but that sci-fi scenario has, in fact, already happened. Indeed, back in 2009, a robotic system made a new scientific discovery with virtually no human intellectual input.",

For example, if we believe that human population growth is a problem, then conscious decisions to reduce human population growth reflect a value decision that we as a society choose to endorse and implement. As another example, consider flooding of small urban streams. Flooding is a hazard experienced by many communities. The study of rivers and their natural processes leads to a number of potential solutions for a given flood hazard. We may choose to place the stream in a concrete box — a remedy that can significantly reduce the flood hazard. Alternatively, we may choose to restore our urban streams and their floodplains, the flat land adjacent to the river that periodically floods, as greenbelts. This choice will reduce damage from flooding while providing habitat for a variety of animals including raccoons, foxes, beavers, and muskrats that use the stream environment; resident and migratory birds that nest, feed, and rest close to a river; and a variety of fish that live in the river system. We will also be more comfortable when interacting with the river. That is why river parks are so popular.",

Ancient texts like The Iliad, paintings from pharaonic Egypt, and Mesopotamian carvings testify that sports like wrestling, sprinting, and javelin throwing helped would-be warriors keep fit and hone combat skills. But not all exercise in the ancient world was combat related. If you were wealthy enough to attend one of the great Athenian schools of philosophy, you would have been advised to exercise as part of your physical education. Philosophers like Plato, Socrates, and Zeno of Citium preached that to live the best possible life, one should exercise not only one's mind but also one's body. This idea is not just Western. Confucius and other prominent Chinese philosophers also taught that exercise was equally essential for physical and mental health and encouraged regular gymnastics and martial arts.",

Let us leave aside the realm of science fiction, where time travelers are able actually to experience the future \"before it happens,\" and concentrate on those visions in which the future is somehow knowable because it is connected to the past and the present. Some scholars see time in much the same way as biologists see living organisms. If biologists know the genetic material of an organism and the conditions in which it lives (its nutrition, for example), and they know the laws that govern its development, they can predict how the mature organism will look and behave. In much the same way, some scholars argue, the future somehow \"grows\" out of conditions in the past and the present. There is a direct and almost physical connection between past and future. If one perceives the present and the past correctly, and if one also knows the laws that govern development or growth, then one can forecast fairly accurately what the future will be like.",

After many years in which theoretical models of health behavior — and intervention efforts based on these models — emphasized knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, and self-efficacy, emotions are increasingly recognized as playing a crucial role. However, attempts to add an emotional component to behavior change interventions have focused almost exclusively on fear. Public service announcements (PSAs) promoting behavior change (e.g., smoking cessation, healthy diet) routinely present frightening facts and images in an effort to scare the viewer into adopting a healthier lifestyle. Although fear appeals are highly memorable, they are effective in promoting behavior change only if they also boost self-efficacy so viewers believe they are able to do whatever is needed to avoid the dangerous outcome; otherwise, they simply tune out the message. Because a typical viewer has already tried several times to make the change in question and failed, this is a substantial challenge.",

            "text": "Education has always emphasized rules and logical thinking. Step-by-step learning proceeds in a predetermined direction (vertical thinking). Researchers have viewed creativity as a mysterious ability that can be fostered but not taught. Psychological studies have found that the natural creativity of children often declines after a couple of years in school.\nAccording to a psychologist Edward de Bono, creativity requires the restructuring of deep-rooted patterns. The ability, whether innate or developed, to go beyond the limitations of previous patterns is integral to that process. Lateral thinking is needed, the fundamental principle of which is that any particular point of view is but one of many possibilities. There are just as many descriptions of a phenomenon as there are perspectives. Lateral thinking seeks alternative patterns instead of simply building on existing models.\nVertical thinking is a gradually increasing process, whereas lateral thinking permits significant leaps. The individual steps involved in lateral thinking need not be correct as long as the ultimate conclusion solves the problem. Instead of constantly evaluating and accepting that which appears to be correct at the moment, an assessment is postponed. Once a certain point has been reached, it is often possible to retrace a logical path to the starting point. Once that has been accomplished, the direction and order of the various steps are unlikely to matter very much. Lateral thinking is like building a vault or a bridge with scaffolding that is torn down once construction has been completed. The various parts of the bridge do not have to stand on their own during each phase of the project. But once the keystone has been laid, the entire structure must be self-supporting.",

Thus, if you assigned each individual to a group by flipping a coin and you had many participants, chance would do a good job of making your groups equivalent. Conversely, if you had few participants, chance would probably do a poor job of balancing the effects of individual differences between groups. Indeed, with too few participants, chance has no chance. For example, (A) <b>[ whether / if ]</b> you had four people in your study and only one of those (B) <b>[ was / were ]</b> violent, flipping a coin could not give you equal groups. Even if you had eight participants, four of (C) <b>[ whom / them ]</b> were violent, flipping a coin might result in all four violent individuals ending up in the same group. Why? Because, in the short run, chance can be unpredictable. For instance, it is not that unusual to get four \"heads\" in a row. To appreciate that chance can be unpredictable in the short run but dependable in the long run, realize that although a casino may lose several bets in a row, the casino always wins in the end.",

Philosophers have been particularly vexed by this question and have developed a range of possible answers to it. On the one hand, the meaning of a concept seems to derive from the meaning of other concepts, as when a child is told the meaning of sprint by saying it is a kind of fast running. On the other hand, the meaning of a concept is connected to observations of things in the world, as when the child actually sees someone sprinting. A concept's meaning is normally not given by definition in terms of other concepts, since successful exact definitions are rare. Nor is meaning exhausted by a set of examples, (A) <b>[ as / even ]</b> if one identified the concept of dog with a set of dogs. A theory of meaning of the concepts must therefore (B) <b>[ include / exclude ]</b> an account of how concepts are related both to each other and to the world. Both aspects are necessary in order for us to understand how concepts (C) <b>[ underlie / overlie ]</b> our ability to use language.",

However, recent changes in volunteer schedule management are proving increasingly challenging for me and many others to sustain our commitment. Previously, volunteers were asked to sign up for available slots on the schedule. This worked very well for all of us because it allowed the flexibility to fit our volunteer time with various other demands on our time. In the last six weeks, though, the new manager of volunteer services has begun __________, causing a great deal of upset among the volunteers and resulting in numerous cancellations of shifts. As unpaid volunteers, we value our autonomy and should not be treated like salaried employees whose working hours can be assigned by management. I hope you can address this problem before it becomes too great to solve. Sincerely,\nKate Greenbaum",

            "text": "Dear Dr. Stevens,\nFor the past four years, volunteering at the Langford Science Museum has been a source of pride since my retirement as a university professor. (A)__________, recent changes in volunteer schedule management are proving increasingly challenging for me and many others to sustain our commitment. (B)__________ volunteers were asked to sign up for available slots on the schedule. This worked very well for all of us because it allowed the flexibility to fit our volunteer time with various other demands on our time. In the last six weeks, though, the new manager of volunteer services has begun assigning us to volunteer schedules without consulting us, causing a great deal of upset among the volunteers and resulting in numerous cancellations of shifts. As unpaid volunteers, we value our autonomy and should not be treated like salaried employees whose working hours can be assigned by management. I hope you can address this problem before it becomes too great to solve.\nSincerely,\nKate Greenbaum",

As the planet warms, high latitudes will warm faster than the tropics, the Mediterranean will become drier, and the tropics will be wetter. But this is like saying you should carry an umbrella in Spain because it is going to rain in Vietnam. To plan for and adapt effectively to climate change, we need information about the future climate at much finer scales than general circulation models (GCMs) can provide. Decisions about whether to put up a dike, move houses, switch crops, or buy insurance require data at scales of less than 100 kilometers. One approach is to embed a finer-scale model of a particular area of interest into a larger-scale GCM. No region __________ so the GCM part of the model can track global dynamics and exchange information with the finer-scale regional climate model.",

Television news, for example, allows for a vivid and dramatic presentation of a story, but may be less suitable than a newspaper or magazine for lengthy and probing analysis. Social networking sites make it easier for us to stay connected to our friends, but make it more difficult to maintain our privacy (especially from advertisers). Caller identification, which is standard on most mobile phones, makes it easier for us to screen our calls, but it also makes it easier for calls that we make to be screened by others. Often the constraints of new technologies are less visible to us than their affordances.

The best-analyzed example involves monkeys' fear of snakes. Monkeys reared in captivity do not exhibit fear the first time they encounter live or toy snakes. If they __________, they later do the same themselves. During the learning trial the naive observer exhibits behavior like the model's (in this case responses such as withdrawal, vocalization, and piloerection). If naive monkeys observe a model behaving fearfully toward a snake and neutrally toward another object like a flower, they acquire the same discrimination. For example, if they are later offered raisins that are out of reach beyond a flower or a snake, they reach quickly over the flower but refuse to reach over the snake.",

He forced himself to learn, review, and recall nonsense words on a specific, timed schedule. What Ebbinghaus discovered was that the rate of forgetting was predictable. He discovered a pattern of exactly how long it took to forget. If he reminded himself of one of his nonsense words just before he knew he was about to forget it — but no sooner — he could save himself hours of studying but still recall the information correctly. The trick was knowing __________. Ebbinghaus's memorization technique became known as spaced repetition. Essentially, it was the most highly specific, scientifically based study schedule you could dream of. Over a hundred years later, specially designed computer programs made following a modified version of Ebbinghaus's schedules feasible.",

This conclusion is based on reasoning about why the human vocal tract has the shape it does. Lieberman notes that to produce vowel sounds such as /i/ (as in meet) and /u/ (as in you), the space above the larynx in the throat has to be about the same length as the horizontal space between the top of the throat and the mouth opening. For natural selection to produce and maintain this arrangement, Lieberman argues, some basic speech abilities must have been present beforehand. Natural selection could then have favored individuals who had physical characteristics that allowed them to produce a wider range of vowel sounds. Unless some basic speech abilities were present prior to the appearance of Homo sapiens, a lowered larynx, and the accompanying ability to produce more vowel sounds, would have to be the result of a massive and incredibly lucky mutation, rather than gradual evolution by natural selection.",

Philosophers have been particularly vexed by this question and have developed a range of possible answers to it. On the one hand, the meaning of a concept seems to derive from the meaning of other concepts, as when a child is told the meaning of sprint by saying it is a kind of fast running. On the other hand, the meaning of a concept is connected to __________ as when the child actually sees someone sprinting. A concept's meaning is normally not given by definition in terms of other concepts, since successful exact definitions are rare. Nor is meaning exhausted by a set of examples, as if one identified the concept of dog with a set of dogs. A theory of meaning of the concepts must therefore include an account of how concepts are related both to each other and to the world. Both aspects are necessary in order for us to understand how concepts underlie our ability to use language.",

But humans are still responsible for forming hypotheses, designing experiments, and drawing conclusions. What if a machine could be responsible for the entire scientific process — formulating a hypothesis, designing and running the experiment, analyzing data, and deciding which experiment to run next — all without human intervention?

Early farmers had to toil as hard as if not harder than hunter-gatherers, and for the last few thousand years farmers primarily exercised, often through sports, to prepare for fighting. Ancient texts like The Iliad, paintings from pharaonic Egypt, and Mesopotamian carvings testify that sports like wrestling, sprinting, and javelin throwing helped would-be warriors keep fit and hone combat skills. But not all exercise in the ancient world was combat related. If you were wealthy enough to attend one of the great Athenian schools of philosophy, you would have been advised to exercise as part of your physical education. Philosophers like Plato, Socrates, and Zeno of Citium preached that to live the best possible life, one should exercise not only one's mind but also one's body. This idea __________. Confucius and other prominent Chinese philosophers also taught that exercise was equally essential for physical and mental health and encouraged regular gymnastics and martial arts.",

Some scholars see time in much the same way as biologists see living organisms. If biologists know the genetic material of an organism and the conditions in which it lives (its nutrition, for example), and they know the laws that govern its development, they can predict how the mature organism will look and behave. In much the same way, some scholars argue, the future somehow \"grows\" out of conditions in the past and the present. There is __________ between past and future.

            "text": "Education has always emphasized rules and logical thinking. Step-by-step learning proceeds in a predetermined direction (vertical thinking). Researchers have viewed creativity as a mysterious ability that can be fostered but not taught. Psychological studies have found that the natural creativity of children often declines after a couple of years in school.\nAccording to a psychologist Edward de Bono, creativity requires the restructuring of deep-rooted patterns. The ability, whether innate or developed, to go beyond the limitations of previous patterns is integral to that process. Lateral thinking is needed, the fundamental principle of which is that any particular point of view is but one of many possibilities. There are just as many descriptions of a phenomenon as there are perspectives. Lateral thinking seeks alternative patterns instead of simply building on existing models.\nVertical thinking is a gradually increasing process, whereas lateral thinking permits significant leaps. The individual steps involved in lateral thinking need not be correct as long as __________. Instead of constantly evaluating and accepting that which appears to be correct at the moment, an assessment is postponed. Once a certain point has been reached, it is often possible to retrace a logical path to the starting point. Once that has been accomplished, the direction and order of the various steps are unlikely to matter very much. Lateral thinking is like building a vault or a bridge with scaffolding that is torn down once construction has been completed. The various parts of the bridge do not have to stand on their own during each phase of the project. But once the keystone has been laid, the entire structure must be self-supporting.",

However, recent changes in volunteer schedule management are proving increasingly challenging for me and many others to sustain our commitment. Previously, volunteers were asked to sign up for available slots on the schedule. This worked very well for all of us because it allowed the flexibility to fit our volunteer time with various other demands on our time. In the last six weeks, though, the new manager of volunteer services has begun assigning us to volunteer schedules without consulting us, causing a great deal of upset among the volunteers and resulting in numerous cancellations of shifts. As unpaid volunteers, we value our autonomy and should not be treated like salaried employees whose working hours can be assigned by management. I hope you can address this problem before it becomes too great to solve.\nSincerely, \nKate Greenbaum",

However, recent changes in volunteer schedule management are proving increasingly (a) <u>challenged</u> for me and many others to sustain our commitment. Previously, volunteers were asked (b) <u>to sign</u> up for available slots on the schedule. This (c) <u>worked</u> very well for all of us because it allowed the flexibility to fit our volunteer time with various other demands on our time. In the last six weeks, though, the new manager of volunteer services has begun assigning us to volunteer schedules without consulting us, causing a great deal of upset among the volunteers and resulting in numerous cancellations of shifts. As unpaid volunteers, we value our autonomy and should not (d) <u>be treated</u> like salaried employees (e) <u>who</u> working hours can be assigned by management. I hope you can address this problem before it becomes too great to solve.\nSincerely,\nKate Greenbaum",

I ran across the house in total darkness, my hands outstretched, blindly feeling for walls and furniture to guide me toward Dustin's bedroom. A violent aftershock knocked me to my knees, but I couldn't stop. <u>나는 무슨 일이 있어도 아들에게 가야 했다</u>. Then, the shaking stopped, and everything became quiet as I peered into my son's bedroom. By now accustomed to the darkness, I could make out that Dustin's bookcases had fallen into the center of the room, narrowly missing his bed. Crawling over the debris, I finally reached Dustin. He was shaking with fear but was huddling safely under the covers. I hugged Dustin tight and breathed a sigh of relief. In that moment, nothing else mattered but the fact that my son was safe.",

Like the bear, we sometimes feel a need to retreat from the world, particularly after periods of stress. When we feel this bear-like urge to carve out restorative time to \"hibernate,\" we should think of it as the sensible impulse of our inner bear. We might consider withdrawing from some social activities to take stock of our lives, start a creative project, plan a trip, or plant seeds of thought that will hopefully spring up and come to fruition in the future. However, we also need to remember that bears come out of their dens once spring arrives. Spending too much time in isolation can deprive us of connection with and inspiration from the outside world. It's best to balance the urge to retreat for restoration with the opportunity to be revitalized by all that the world has to offer.",

While we can (and do) dismiss the moral importance of plant experiences, to pretend that they don't exist is a very dangerous form of disregard. Our cold, utilitarian approach to reducing climate change has so far been largely ineffectual. To bring real change, we need to learn to see plants as independent, intrinsically valuable, sentient beings — not mere tools for our own human flourishing. Our welfare is deeply dependent upon the welfare of plants, and the best way for us to make sense of this is by reminding ourselves that they are persons. They have just as much of a right to clean water, healthy soil, and a liveable atmosphere as the rest of us, and this needs to be remembered when we consider the ethical dimensions of climate change.",

While we can (and do) dismiss the moral importance of plant experiences, to pretend that they don't exist is a very dangerous form of disregard. Our cold, utilitarian approach to reducing climate change has so far been largely ineffectual. To bring real change, we need to learn to see plants as independent, intrinsically valuable, sentient beings — not mere tools for our own human flourishing. Our welfare is deeply dependent upon the welfare of plants, and __________. They have just as much of a right to clean water, healthy soil, and a liveable atmosphere as the rest of us, and this needs to be remembered when we consider the ethical dimensions of climate change.",

In fact, global sports spread more like the bubonic plague than the burrito. They are global phenomena that emerged almost exclusively from Western civilization — from European nations and European settler societies — and spread to other parts of the world. Take, for instance, soccer (association football). Before European contact, ball games that limited or barred the use of the hands flourished in Mesoamerica. Today, fútbol ignites the passions of millions of Mexicans. Estadio Azteca has been filled to overflowing for two World Cup finals (1970 and 1986) and a multitude of other international matches. You might easily conclude that fútbol fused Mesoamerican and European sporting pastimes, much like pizza and pasta fused Old World and New World food. It did not.",

At the age of 12, she became the youngest person ever to attend the Pratt Institute, which was especially renowned for art and design. She also studied under the Ukrainian American artist Alexander Archipenko, who dramatically influenced her style. Sewell's early work was as both an author and an illustrator. In 1924, she illustrated her first book, Susanne K. Langer's The Cruise of the Little Dipper, and Other Fairy Tales. She illustrated her own book, ABC for Everyday, in 1930 and a year later collaborated with her younger sister on Building a House in Sweden. She also illustrated classic works, including those by American poet Emily Dickinson and British authors like Jane Austen. During her career, Sewell illustrated more than 50 books. She won a Caldecott Honor in 1955 for her illustrations in The Thanksgiving Story by American author Alice Dalgliesh.",

            "text": "When given many chances, chance will tend to distribute random differences fairly equally. However, when given few chances, it may distribute random differences very unequally. Thus, if you assigned each individual to a group by flipping a coin and you had many participants, chance would do a good job of making your groups equivalent. Conversely, if you had few participants, chance would probably do a poor job of balancing the effects of individual differences between groups. Indeed, with too few participants, chance has no chance. For example, if you had four people in your study and only one of those was violent, flipping a coin could not give you equal groups. Even if you had eight participants, four of whom were violent, flipping a coin might result in all four violent individuals ending up in the same group. Why? Because, in the short run, chance can be unpredictable. For instance, it is not that unusual to get four \"heads\" in a row. To appreciate that chance can be unpredictable in the short run but dependable in the long run, realize that although a casino may lose several bets in a row, the casino always wins in the end.",

            "text": "Linguist Philip Lieberman argues that human ancestors (e.g., Homo erectus) had the ability to speak, although their speech would not have been as refined as modern humans' speech. This conclusion is based on reasoning about why the human vocal tract has the shape it does. Lieberman notes that to produce vowel sounds such as /i/ (as in meet) and /u/ (as in you), the space above the larynx in the throat has to be about the same length as the horizontal space between the top of the throat and the mouth opening. For natural selection to produce and maintain this arrangement, Lieberman argues, some basic speech abilities must have been present beforehand. Natural selection could then have favored individuals who had physical characteristics that allowed them to produce a wider range of vowel sounds. Unless some basic speech abilities were present prior to the appearance of Homo sapiens, a lowered larynx, and the accompanying ability to produce more vowel sounds, would have to be the result of a massive and incredibly lucky mutation, rather than gradual evolution by natural selection.",

Philosophers have been particularly vexed by this question and have developed a range of possible answers to it. On the one hand, the meaning of a concept seems to derive from the meaning of other concepts, as when a child is told the meaning of sprint by saying it is a kind of fast running. On the other hand, the meaning of a concept is connected to observations of things in the world, as when the child actually sees someone sprinting. A concept's meaning is normally not given by definition in terms of other concepts, since successful exact definitions are rare. Nor is meaning exhausted by a set of examples, as if one identified the concept of dog with a set of dogs. A theory of meaning of the concepts must therefore include an account of how concepts are related both to each other and to the world. Both aspects are necessary in order for us to understand how concepts underlie our ability to use language.",

Philosophers have been particularly vexed by this question and have developed a range of possible answers to it. On the one hand, the meaning of a concept seems to derive from the meaning of other concepts, as __________. On the other hand, the meaning of a concept is connected to observations of things in the world, as when the child actually sees someone sprinting. A concept's meaning is normally not given by definition in terms of other concepts, since successful exact definitions are rare. Nor is meaning exhausted by a set of examples, as if one identified the concept of dog with a set of dogs. A theory of meaning of the concepts must therefore include an account of how concepts are related both to each other and to the world. Both aspects are necessary in order for us to understand how concepts underlie our ability to use language.",

Sometimes, however, potential parties to a verbal exchange find themselves sharing little more than physical proximity to one another. Such situations arise when members of communities with radically different language traditions and no history of previous contact with one another come face to face and are forced to communicate. There is no way to predict the outcome of such enforced contact on either speech community, yet from these new shared experiences, new forms of practice, including a new form of language ― pidgin ― may develop.",

For example, if we believe that human population growth is a problem, then conscious decisions to reduce human population growth reflect a value decision that we as a society choose to endorse and implement. As another example, consider flooding of small urban streams. Flooding is a hazard experienced by many communities. The study of rivers and their natural processes leads to a number of potential solutions for a given flood hazard. We may choose to place the stream in a concrete box — a remedy that can significantly reduce the flood hazard. Alternatively, we may choose to restore our urban streams and their floodplains, the flat land adjacent to the river that periodically floods, as greenbelts. This choice will reduce damage from flooding while providing habitat for a variety of animals including raccoons, foxes, beavers, and muskrats that use the stream environment; resident and migratory birds that nest, feed, and rest close to a river; and a variety of fish that live in the river system. We will also be more comfortable when interacting with the river. That is why river parks are so popular.",

Early farmers had to toil as hard as if not harder than hunter-gatherers, and for the last few thousand years farmers primarily exercised, often through sports, to prepare for fighting. Ancient texts like The Iliad, paintings from pharaonic Egypt, and Mesopotamian carvings testify that sports like wrestling, sprinting, and javelin throwing helped would-be warriors keep fit and hone combat skills. But not all exercise in the ancient world was combat related. If you were wealthy enough to attend one of the great Athenian schools of philosophy, you would have been advised to exercise as part of your physical education. Philosophers like Plato, Socrates, and Zeno of Citium preached that to live the best possible life, one should exercise not only one's mind but also one's body. This idea is not just Western. Confucius and other prominent Chinese philosophers also taught that exercise was equally essential for physical and mental health and encouraged regular gymnastics and martial arts.",

After many years in which theoretical models of health behavior — and intervention efforts based on these models — emphasized knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, and self-efficacy, emotions are increasingly recognized as playing a crucial role. However, attempts to add an emotional component to behavior change interventions have focused almost exclusively on fear. Public service announcements (PSAs) promoting behavior change (e.g., smoking cessation, healthy diet) routinely present frightening facts and images in an effort to scare the viewer into adopting a healthier lifestyle. Although fear appeals are highly memorable, they are effective in promoting behavior change only if they also boost self-efficacy so viewers believe they are able to do whatever is needed to avoid the dangerous outcome; otherwise, they simply tune out the message. Because a typical viewer has already tried several times to make the change in question and failed, this is a substantial challenge.",

            "text": "Education has always emphasized rules and logical thinking. Step-by-step learning proceeds in a predetermined direction (vertical thinking). Researchers have viewed creativity (a) <u>as</u> a mysterious ability that can be fostered but not taught. Psychological studies have found that the natural creativity of children often declines after a couple of years in school.\nAccording to a psychologist Edward de Bono, creativity requires the restructuring of deep-rooted patterns. The ability, whether innate or developed, to go beyond the limitations of previous patterns is integral to that process. Lateral thinking is needed, the fundamental principle of (b) <u>which</u> is that any particular point of view is but one of many possibilities. There are just as many descriptions of a phenomenon as there are perspectives. Lateral thinking seeks alternative patterns instead of simply building on (c) <u>existed</u> models.\nVertical thinking is a gradually increasing process, whereas lateral thinking permits significant leaps. The individual steps involved in lateral thinking need not be correct as long as the ultimate conclusion solves the problem. Instead of constantly evaluating and accepting that which appears to be correct at the moment, an assessment is postponed. Once a certain point (d) <u>has been reached</u>, it is often possible to retrace a logical path to the starting point. Once that has been accomplished, the direction and order of the various steps are unlikely to matter very much. Lateral thinking is like building a vault or a bridge with scaffolding that is (e) <u>tearing</u> down once construction has been completed. The various parts of the bridge do not have to stand on their own during each phase of the project. But once the keystone has been laid, the entire structure must be self-supporting.",

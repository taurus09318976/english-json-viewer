It wasn&apos;t long before a trend was noticed: a few teams were consistently being selected to compete. Of course, this wasn&apos;t just luck. As college football teams win games, they become more likely to be shown on television. The heightened exposure attracts more fans and also helps the program recruit the most talented new prospects. ① <u>This, in turn, boosts ticket sales and donations, making the program even more desirable for top athletes and increasing the chances that the team will sustain its success into the future</u>. ② <u>This feedback loop explains the trend of a few teams making regular playoff appearances</u>. Similar patterns can be observed when we turn our gaze to the natural world. ③ <u>It is impossible for two different species to live in the exact same environment while competing for the same food and resources</u>. ④ <u>One of these species will reproduce more quickly or use the available resources more effectively or efficiently than the other</u>. Advantages such as these will allow the species to increase its population more easily. ⑤ <u>The introduction of a species into a particular ecosystem may destroy a balanced food chain</u>. As a result, the dominant species has no need to fight against the other, since its dominant population leaves fewer and fewer resources for its struggling competitor.

            "text": "For many years, the College Football Playoff selection committee chose four teams to compete for the championship. It wasn't long before a trend was noticed: a few teams were consistently being selected to compete. Of course, this wasn't just luck. As college football teams win games, they become more likely to be shown on television. The heightened exposure attracts more fans and also helps the program recruit the most talented new prospects. ① <u>This, in turn, boosts ticket sales and donations, making the program even more desirable for top athletes and increasing the chances that the team will sustain its success into the future</u>. ② <u>This feedback loop explains the trend of a few teams making regular playoff appearances</u>. Similar patterns can be observed when we turn our gaze to the natural world. ③ <u>It is impossible for two different species to live in the exact same environment while competing for the same food and resources</u>. ④ <u>One of these species will reproduce more quickly or use the available resources more effectively or efficiently than the other</u>. Advantages such as these will allow the species to increase its population more easily. ⑤ <u>The introduction of a species into a particular ecosystem may destroy a balanced food chain</u>. As a result, the dominant species has no need to fight against the other, since its dominant population leaves fewer and fewer resources for its struggling competitor.

If the only thing you do is memorize a lot of vocabulary words, you won't know how to put them together into grammatically correct sentences. You will have acquired a great deal of knowledge, but without actually making use of the language, you will still lack a real understanding of it. In other words, you will have gathered a lot of pieces, but you won't know how to put them together. The same is also true of mathematics. Memorizing a lot of formulas and equations can help you get by, but it does not lead to true understanding. It will not enable you to see mathematical patterns or solve advanced problems.

It wasn't long before a trend was noticed: a few teams were consistently being selected to compete. Of course, this wasn't just luck. As college football teams win games, they become more likely to be shown on television. The heightened exposure attracts more fans and also helps the program recruit the most talented new prospects. This, in turn, boosts ticket sales and donations, making the program even more desirable for top athletes and increasing the chances that the team will sustain its success into the future. This feedback loop explains the trend of a few teams making regular playoff appearances. Similar patterns can be observed when we turn our gaze to the natural world. It is impossible for two different species to live in the exact same environment while competing for the same food and resources. One of these species will reproduce more quickly or use the available resources more effectively or efficiently than the other. Advantages such as these will allow the species to increase its population more easily. As a result, the dominant species has no need to fight against the other, since its dominant population leaves fewer and fewer resources for its struggling competitor. This forces the weaker species to use different resources, move to another location, or die out completely.",

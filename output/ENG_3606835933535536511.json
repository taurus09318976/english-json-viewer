Together we dashed toward the Christmas tree where James was already opening his first gift. The box was beautifully wrapped in sparkling red and green paper with an elaborate bow on top. Underneath the tree, dozens of other presents were waiting to be opened. \"Merry Christmas, kids!\" my parents said. I began to check the boxes one by one. There were many gifts for James and Lisa, but there was nothing for me. As my siblings proudly displayed their gifts, I looked up at my parents. Tears started to fill my eyes.",

Then, from above him, the knocking sound echoed down. The attic! He moved slowly to the kitchen, where he picked up a flashlight. His hand shook so much that the light jumped back and forth in front of him. He began to climb the stairs. It seemed to take an hour to walk up them. Now he could see the attic door — and hear more noises coming from it. There was a scratching sound, as if something was trying to get out. He hesitated. At that moment, the door flew open. Eric jumped backwards and almost fell as his terrified cat, Calvin, ran past him. \"Calvin! How did you get in there?\" Eric shouted. He sighed and went back downstairs.",

Drawing closer to the landing field, she could see her friends and family smiling up at her, waving and shouting. After she lightly touched down on the soft grass and brought her glider to a stop, they crowded around her, congratulating her on her first flight. Her father barely waited for her to get out of the glider before wrapping her in a hug. \"How do you feel?\" he asked. Hanna just grinned and replied, \"When can I do it again?\"",

Together we dashed toward the Christmas tree where James was already opening his first gift. The box was beautifully wrapped in sparkling red and green paper with an elaborate bow on top. Underneath the tree, dozens of other presents were waiting to be opened. \"Merry Christmas, kids!\" my parents said. I began to check the boxes one by one. There were many gifts for James and Lisa, but there was nothing for me. As my siblings proudly displayed their gifts, I looked up at my parents. Tears started to fill my eyes.",

As a loud \"boom!\" rang out, the athletes sprang away from the starting line and went flying around the track. There were three skaters in front of Andre. At the first turn, he slid easily around the last one and held his place at third. Two more laps passed; he tried to push forward but was stopped by his rivals each time. The seconds flew by, and the finish line was approaching. With all his effort, Andre made his last attempt to pass. At that same moment, the skater in second place tried to pass on the inside. He miscalculated and brushed the leader, causing them both to fall. With no one in his way now, Andre rocketed across the finish line. Around him, the crowd cheered his name.

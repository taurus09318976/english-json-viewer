They did this repeatedly over a period of time and then measured the cockroaches' salivation behavior when their antennae ② <u>exposed</u> to various smells. What they found was that the cockroaches began to salivate when exposed to vanilla and peppermint. However, when a different odor was used, they did not have the same reaction.

Walking into the gym, <u>he couldn't help but imagine</u> all of the moves that his father was about to teach him, and he was eager to begin. To Nathan's surprise, however, his father didn't teach him anything about punching or kicking that day or in the days that followed. Instead, he taught him breathing exercises and slow, controlled movements. Frustrated, Nathan finally confronted his father. He said, \"How can I become a great fighter if you won't teach me how to throw a punch?\" His father just smiled and said, \"Martial arts isn't about becoming a great fighter. It's about learning control and how to avoid fights.\"",

They did this repeatedly over a period of time and then measured the cockroaches' salivation behavior when their antennae were exposed to various smells.

One night he was watching a PBS-TV program about cartooning, when he decided to write to the host of the show, Jack Cassady, to ask for his advice about becoming a cartoonist. Much to his surprise, he heard back from Cassady within a few weeks in the form of a handwritten letter. The letter advised Adams not to be discouraged if he received early rejections. Adams got inspired and submitted some cartoons, but he was quickly rejected. Not following Cassady's advice, he became discouraged, put his materials away, and decided to forget cartooning as a career. About fifteen months later, he was surprised to receive yet another letter from Cassady, especially since he hadn't thanked him for his original advice. He acted again on Cassady's encouragement, but this time he stuck with it and obviously hit it big.",

Now, after making several television appearances and signing a deal with a major sports league, Samuel has turned his homemade neckties into a business worth over one million dollars. And he is doing it all while maintaining good grades in school! In a recent family interview, Samuel's father explained that he always encouraged his son's creativity, and he proudly wears a homemade necktie to work each day. Talking about his future, Samuel said that he intends to finish high school and then become an influential fashion designer.",

They even have their own holiday, called Pickle Day, which is celebrated on November 14 in the United States. Vegetables are the key ingredient in making pickles. To start with, they are immersed in vinegar or an extremely salty water called brine. This kicks off the fermentation process, which extends their shelf life by killing harmful bacteria. Some of the most common pickle varieties are made from cucumbers, onions, or radishes. Although their exact origin remains a mystery, scientists have found clues about the first pickles. Some evidence suggests that they were invented in ancient Mesopotamia using Indian cucumbers. However, other findings point to China, where they were created as a snack for workers building the Great Wall.",

Walking into the gym, he couldn't help but imagine all of the moves that his father was about to teach him, and he was eager to begin. To Nathan's surprise, however, his father didn't teach him anything about punching or kicking that day or in the days that followed. Instead, he taught him breathing exercises and slow, controlled movements. Frustrated, Nathan finally confronted his father. He said, \"How can I become a great fighter if you won't teach me how to throw a punch?\" His father just smiled and said, \"Martial arts isn't about becoming a great fighter.

            "text": "Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov is credited with creating the first instance of behavioral conditioning by triggering dogs' salivation with a bell. Now, Japanese scientists have reproduced this reaction in cockroaches. They managed to make the insects respond to certain smells, such as peppermint and vanilla. To achieve this, they gave the cockroaches a sugary liquid right after releasing these scents. They did this repeatedly over a period of time and then measured the cockroaches' salivation behavior when their antennae were exposed to various smells. What they found was that the cockroaches began to salivate when exposed to vanilla and peppermint. However, when a different odor was used, they did not have the same reaction. Thus, the researchers successfully conditioned the animals to physiologically __________, just like Pavlov's dogs responded to the bell.",

When Reinagle visited the exhibition, he studied the painting closely. \"But I like the sky!\" he said to himself aloud. Stanfield, passing nearby, overheard Reinagle and asked him what he meant. \"Well,\" said Reinagle, \"Constable told me that the sky looked like mud.\" Stanfield then approached Constable and accused him of lying: \"You praised the sky in my painting before, but you told Reinagle it looks like mud!\" Constable replied, \"Yes! I happen to like mud!\"",

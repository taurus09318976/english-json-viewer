It is common, for example, for someone to be willing to drive across town to save $10 on a $20 clock radio, but unwilling to do so to save $10 on a $1,000 television set. Yet the benefit of making the drive is $10 in each case. So if the implicit cost of the drive were less than $10, a rational person would drive across town in both cases. People often explain their reluctance to make the drive for the television by saying the $10 savings is such a small percentage of its price. But a rational person reckons benefits and costs in absolute terms, not <u>as percentages</u>.",

Too often, we pretend to be listening while our mind is racing, trying to think of something clever. However, being clever is not being wise. In addition, to exacerbate our narcissistic tendencies, there is also the kind of listening with half an ear that presumes we already know what the other person is going to say. I am referring to inattentive listening, only waiting for a chance to speak, and even becoming impatient, wishing to get rid of the other person. As the philosopher and poet Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, \"There is a difference between truly listening and waiting for your turn to talk.\" This urge to interrupt and get a word in can be quite powerful. Some people just want to hear themselves speak to confirm and validate their existence. It has been said that big egos <u>have little ears</u>.",

It is common, for example, for someone to be willing to drive across town to save &#36;10 on a &#36;20 clock radio, but unwilling to do so to save &#36;10 on a &#36;1,000 television set. Yet the benefit of making the drive is &#36;10 in each case. So if the implicit cost of the drive were less than &#36;10, a rational person would drive across town in both cases. People often explain their reluctance to make the drive for the television by saying the &#36;10 savings is such a small percentage of its price. But a rational person reckons benefits and costs in absolute terms, not as percentages.",

One of my clients was struggling with how some of their Baby Boomer employees were trying to build personal relationships with Millennial employees. A few of these employees read articles that recommended specific methods for communicating with each generation. The Boomer employees then went on to use this information to inform how they communicated with all of their coworkers of various generations. They walked to the offices of their Baby Boomer peers, emailed Gen X colleagues, and texted Millennials. On the surface, this seemed fine, but it soon started to stir up some controversy because people did not understand why they were getting an email, when someone else was getting a face-to-face conversation. By limiting in-person conversation to only certain coworkers, these employees unintentionally made others feel left out and undervalued.",

These discoveries testify to the advanced technology that our ancestors applied to create music: the finger holes are carefully bevelled to allow the musician's fingers to make a tight seal; and the distances between the holes appear to have been precisely measured, perhaps to correspond to a specific musical scale. This time period corresponds to the last glaciation episode in the Northern Hemisphere — life could not have been easy for people living at that time. Yet time, energy, and the skills of craftworkers were used for making abstract sounds \"of the least use ... to daily habits of life.\" So, music must have been very meaningful and important for them.",

            "text": "Sometimes, even seemingly unlucky starts turn out to make long-run success more likely. Gladwell cites the experience of Jews who immigrated to New York in the early twentieth century and went on to prosper in the garment industry. Many raised children who graduated from law school, only to be rejected by leading New York law firms, which in those days hired mostly lawyers from wealthy Protestant families. Jewish graduates were often left with few better options than to start small firms of their own. Those firms often specialized in cases that the elite law firms felt were beneath them, such as the litigation of hostile corporate takeovers. The lawyers raised by garment workers were thus often the only ones who had developed the expertise to capitalize on the explosive growth of hostile takeover litigation that occurred in the 1970s and 1980s. By dominating that new market, they went on to earn vastly more than the lawyers in the firms that had earlier shunned them.",

            "text": "Let's take a classical example from cognitive psychology: the effect of word processing depth. Imagine that I present a list of sixty words to three groups of students. I ask the first group to decide whether the words' letters are upper- or lowercase; the second group, whether the words rhyme with \"chair\"; and the third, whether they are animal names or not. Once the students are finished, I give them a memory test. Which group remembers the words best? Memory turns out to be much better in the third group, who processed the words in depth, at the meaning level ( 75 percent success), than in the other two groups, who processed the more superficial sensory aspects of the words, either at the letter level ( 33 percent success) or the rhyme level ( 52 percent success). We do find a weak implicit and unconscious trace of the words in all groups: learning leaves its subliminal mark within the spelling and phonological systems. However, only in-depth semantic processing guarantees explicit, detailed memory of the words. The same phenomenon occurs at the level of sentences: students who make the effort to understand sentences on their own, without teacher guidance, show much better retention of information. This is a general rule, which the American psychologist Henry Roediger states as follows: \"Making learning conditions more difficult, thus requiring students to engage more cognitive effort, often leads to enhanced retention.\"",

More importantly, the natural home they depended on was much less likely to be severely damaged than the crops and structures the agricultural community relied on. By replacing their natural home with an artificial construction, the farmers, paradoxically enough, had made themselves more defenseless to natural disasters; in fact, natural events that were not at all disasters for the foragers became disasters for them.",

One famous brand of house paints has more than two thousand colors in its commercial palette. Many of these are labeled with unique (and decidedly nonbasic) English names: violet posy, wing commander, Aztec tan. But even allowing nonbasic terms and even allowing the highly specialized vocabulary of the paint industry, the distinctions that languages make in the color space are astronomically small in comparison to well over 2 million distinctions in color that the human eye can discern. Even in highly specialized, technical vocabularies, the total inventory of color terms in use makes less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the discernible distinctions in color that the human visual system can make. The everyday vocabulary that most people use will be one hundred times less than that again. Our perceptual experience is rich, but our language comes nowhere close to that richness. If you think that language is good for capturing perceptual experience, think again.",

They used the commons to conduct small-scale agriculture, collect wood for fuel and cooking, and raise small amounts of livestock for their families. As global demand for wool to be used in clothing and other goods increased, landowners sought more grazing land to increase wool production, so they privatized the commons, fencing them off and thus cutting off access to the peasants. By this process of the enclosure of the commons, peasants were cut off from land that had been their primary resource for survival for centuries. Today, there are interesting correlations between the physical commons of English pasturelands and the digital commons of the internet. Both are rich with opportunities for self-subsistence, expression, and flourishing; both are full of challenges from enclosure and landlords (e.g., platform owners who charge fees for access or use).",

            "text": "The reason listening can be so difficult appears to be our narcissistic disposition. Too often, we pretend to be listening while our mind is racing, trying to think of something clever. However, being clever is not being wise. In addition, to exacerbate our narcissistic tendencies, there is also the kind of listening with half an ear that presumes we already know what the other person is going to say. I am referring to inattentive listening, only waiting for a chance to speak, and even becoming impatient, wishing to get rid of the other person. As the philosopher and poet Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, \"There is a difference between truly listening and waiting for your turn to talk.\" This urge to interrupt and get a word in can be quite powerful. Some people just want to hear themselves speak to confirm and validate their existence. It has been said that big egos have little ears.",

Every time you harvest a crop and eat it, the nitrogen (and other nutrients) in those plants, the very nutrients that make that crop good food, are taken out of the soil and moved to wherever you are. Some of those nutrients accumulate in your body (if you are growing), but most pass through. Either way, unless you and your waste are returned to the farm, there is a net loss of nutrients from the soil — a net withdrawal from the nutrient bank. When there were relatively few people, most of whom lived, went to the bathroom, and died on or near the farm, leaving fields uncultivated or planting legumes and plowing them under was a reasonably sustainable way to produce food. But for eight billion people? Or for ten? The food required to feed all of us requires a lot of nitrogen to be removed from farms, and it needs to be replaced, or the soil bank account of nitrogen will run out. This means feeding the world requires industrially produced nitrogen fertilizer, at least for the foreseeable future, until we figure out a safe and effective way to return the nutrients passing through humans to the farm soil where they came. In other words, we thrive because of our innovations in capturing nitrogen.",

Yet the benefit of making the drive is &#36;10 in each case. So if the implicit cost of the drive were less than &#36;10, a rational person would drive across town in both cases. People often explain their reluctance to make the drive for the television by saying the &#36;10 savings is such a small percentage of its price.

One of my clients was struggling with how some of their Baby Boomer employees were trying to build personal relationships with Millennial employees. A few of these employees read articles that recommended specific methods for communicating with each generation. The Boomer employees then went on to use this information to inform how they communicated with all of their coworkers of various generations. They walked to the offices of their Baby Boomer peers, emailed Gen X colleagues, and texted Millennials. On the surface, this seemed fine, but it soon started to stir up some controversy because people did not understand why they were getting an email, when someone else was getting a face-to-face conversation. By limiting in-person conversation to only certain coworkers, these employees unintentionally made others feel left out and undervalued.",

These discoveries testify to the advanced technology that our ancestors applied to create music: the finger holes are carefully bevelled to allow the musician's fingers to make a tight seal; and the distances between the holes appear to have been precisely measured, perhaps to correspond to a specific musical scale. This time period corresponds to the last glaciation episode in the Northern Hemisphere — life could not have been easy for people living at that time. Yet time, energy, and the skills of craftworkers were used for making abstract sounds \"of the least use ... to daily habits of life.\" So, music must have been very meaningful and important for them.",

Gladwell cites the experience of Jews who immigrated to New York in the early twentieth century and went on to prosper in the garment industry. Many raised children who graduated from law school, only to be rejected by leading New York law firms, which in those days hired mostly lawyers from wealthy Protestant families. Jewish graduates were often left with few better options than to start small firms of their own. Those firms often specialized in cases that the elite law firms felt were beneath them, such as the litigation of hostile corporate takeovers. The lawyers raised by garment workers were thus often the only ones who had developed the expertise to capitalize on the explosive growth of hostile takeover litigation that occurred in the 1970s and 1980s. By dominating that new market, they went on to earn vastly more than the lawyers in the firms that had earlier shunned them.",

            "text": "Let's take a classical example from cognitive psychology: the effect of word processing depth. Imagine that I present a list of sixty words to three groups of students. I ask the first group to decide whether the words' letters are upper- or lowercase; the second group, whether the words rhyme with \"chair\"; and the third, whether they are animal names or not. Once the students are finished, I give them a memory test. Which group remembers the words best? Memory turns out to be much better in the third group, who processed the words in depth, at the meaning level (75 percent success), than in the other two groups, who processed the more superficial sensory aspects of the words, either at the letter level (33 percent success) or the rhyme level (52 percent success). We do find a weak implicit and unconscious trace of the words in all groups: learning leaves its subliminal mark within the spelling and phonological systems. However, only in-depth semantic processing guarantees explicit, detailed memory of the words. The same phenomenon occurs at the level of sentences: students who make the effort to understand sentences on their own, without teacher guidance, show much better retention of information. This is a general rule, which the American psychologist Henry Roediger states as follows: \"Making learning conditions more difficult, thus requiring students to engage more cognitive effort, often leads to enhanced retention.\"",

More importantly, the natural home they depended on was much less likely to be severely damaged than the crops and structures the agricultural community relied on.

Even in highly specialized, technical vocabularies, the total inventory of color terms in use makes less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the discernible distinctions in color that the human visual system can make. The everyday vocabulary that most people use will be one hundred times less than that again. Our perceptual experience is rich, but our language comes nowhere close to that richness. If you think that language is good for capturing perceptual experience, think again.",

            "text": "In Britain, large open areas of land known as the commons were the property of landowning nobility but were accessible for use by peasants. They used the commons to conduct small-scale agriculture, collect wood for fuel and cooking, and raise small amounts of livestock for their families. As global demand for wool to be used in clothing and other goods increased, landowners sought more grazing land to increase wool production, so they privatized the commons, fencing them off and thus cutting off access to the peasants. By this process of the enclosure of the commons, peasants were cut off from land that had been their primary resource for survival for centuries. Today, there are interesting correlations between the physical commons of English pasturelands and the digital commons of the internet. Both are rich with opportunities for self-subsistence, expression, and flourishing; both are full of challenges from enclosure and landlords (e.g., platform owners who charge fees for access or use).",

Too often, we pretend to be listening while our mind is racing, trying to think of something clever. However, being clever is not being wise. In addition, to exacerbate our narcissistic tendencies, there is also the kind of listening with half an ear that presumes we already know what the other person is going to say. I am referring to inattentive listening, only waiting for a chance to speak, and even becoming impatient, wishing to get rid of the other person. As the philosopher and poet Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, \"There is a difference between truly listening and waiting for your turn to talk.\" This urge to interrupt and get a word in can be quite powerful. Some people just want to hear themselves speak to confirm and validate their existence. It has been said that big egos have little ears.",

            "text": "The bank account analogy helps express why increased agricultural production must be accompanied by fertilizer use. Every time you harvest a crop and eat it, the nitrogen (and other nutrients) in those plants, the very nutrients that make that crop good food, are taken out of the soil and moved to wherever you are. Some of those nutrients accumulate in your body (if you are growing), but most pass through. Either way, unless you and your waste are returned to the farm, there is a net loss of nutrients from the soil — a net withdrawal from the nutrient bank. When there were relatively few people, most of whom lived, went to the bathroom, and died on or near the farm, leaving fields uncultivated or planting legumes and plowing them under was a reasonably sustainable way to produce food. But for eight billion people? Or for ten? The food required to feed all of us requires a lot of nitrogen to be removed from farms, and it needs to be replaced, or the soil bank account of nitrogen will run out. This means feeding the world requires industrially produced nitrogen fertilizer, at least for the foreseeable future, until we figure out a safe and effective way to return the nutrients passing through humans to the farm soil where they came. In other words, we thrive because of our innovations in capturing nitrogen.",

Yet the benefit of making the drive is &#36;10 in each case. So if the implicit cost of the drive were less than &#36;10, a rational person would drive across town in both cases. People often explain their reluctance to make the drive for the television by saying the &#36;10 savings is __________.

One of my clients was struggling with how some of their Baby Boomer employees were trying to build personal relationships with Millennial employees.

On the surface, this seemed fine, but it soon\n__________ because people did not understand why they were getting an email, when someone else was getting a face-to-face conversation.

Gladwell cites the experience of Jews who immigrated to New York in the early twentieth century and went on to prosper in the garment industry. Many raised children who graduated from law school, only to be rejected by leading New York law firms, which in those days hired mostly lawyers from wealthy Protestant families. Jewish graduates were often left with few better options than to start small firms of their own. Those firms often specialized in cases that the elite law firms felt were beneath them, such as the litigation of hostile corporate takeovers. The lawyers raised by garment workers were thus often the only ones who had developed the expertise to capitalize on the explosive growth of hostile takeover litigation that occurred in the 1970s and 1980s. By dominating that new market, they went on to earn vastly more than the lawyers in the firms that had earlier shunned them.",

            "text": "Let's take a classical example from cognitive psychology: the effect of word processing depth. Imagine that I present a list of sixty words to three groups of students. I ask the first group to decide whether the words' letters are upper- or lowercase; the second group, whether the words rhyme with \"chair\"; and the third, whether they are animal names or not. Once the students are finished, I give them a memory test. Which group remembers the words best? Memory turns out to be much better in the third group, who processed the words in depth, at the meaning level ( 75 percent success), than in the other two groups, who processed the more superficial sensory aspects of the words, either at the letter level ( 33 percent success) or the rhyme level (52 percent success). We do find a weak implicit and unconscious trace of the words in all groups: learning leaves its subliminal mark within the spelling and phonological systems. However, __________ guarantees explicit, detailed memory of the words. The same phenomenon occurs at the level of sentences: students who make the effort to understand sentences on their own, without teacher guidance, show much better retention of information. This is a general rule, which the American psychologist Henry Roediger states as follows: \"Making learning conditions more difficult, thus requiring students to engage more cognitive effort, often leads to enhanced retention.\"",

One famous brand of house paints has more than two thousand colors in its commercial palette. Many of these are labeled with unique (and decidedly nonbasic) English names: violet posy, wing commander, Aztec tan. But even allowing nonbasic terms and even allowing the highly specialized vocabulary of the paint industry, the distinctions that languages make in the color space are astronomically small in comparison to well over 2 million distinctions in color that the human eye can discern. Even in highly specialized, technical vocabularies, the total inventory of color terms in use makes less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the discernible distinctions in color that the human visual system can make. The everyday vocabulary that most people use will be one hundred times less than that again. Our perceptual experience is rich, but our language comes nowhere close to that richness.

They used the commons to conduct small-scale agriculture, collect wood for fuel and cooking, and raise small amounts of livestock for their families. As global demand for wool to be used in clothing and other goods increased, landowners sought more grazing land to increase wool production, so they privatized the commons, fencing them off and thus cutting off access to the peasants. By this process of the enclosure of the commons, peasants were cut off from land that had been their primary resource for survival for centuries. Today, __________ between the physical commons of English pasturelands and the digital commons of the internet. Both are rich with opportunities for self-subsistence, expression, and flourishing; both are full of challenges from enclosure and landlords (e.g., platform owners who charge fees for access or use).",

            "text": "The bank account analogy helps express why increased agricultural production must be accompanied by fertilizer use. Every time you harvest a crop and eat it, the nitrogen (and other nutrients) in those plants, the very nutrients that make that crop good food, are taken out of the soil and moved to wherever you are. Some of those nutrients accumulate in your body (if you are growing), but most pass through. Either way, unless you and your waste are returned to the farm, there is a net loss of nutrients from the soil — a net withdrawal from the nutrient bank. When there were relatively few people, most of whom lived, went to the bathroom, and died on or near the farm, leaving fields uncultivated or planting legumes and plowing them under was a reasonably sustainable way to produce food. But for eight billion people? Or for ten? The food required to feed all of us requires a lot of nitrogen to be removed from farms, and it needs to be replaced, or the soil bank account of nitrogen will run out. This means feeding the world requires industrially produced nitrogen fertilizer, at least for the foreseeable future, until we figure out a safe and effective way to return the nutrients passing through humans to the farm soil where they came. In other words, we thrive because of __________.",

It is common, for example, for someone to be willing to drive across town to save $10 on a $20 clock radio, but unwilling to do so to save $10 on a $1,000 television set. Yet the benefit of making the drive is $10 in each case. So if the implicit cost of the drive were less than $10, a rational person would drive across town in both cases. People often explain their reluctance to make the drive for the television by saying the $10 savings is such a small percentage of its price. But a rational person reckons benefits and costs in absolute terms, not as percentages.",

            "text": "Let's take a classical example from cognitive psychology: the effect of word processing depth. Imagine that I present a list of sixty words to three groups of students. I ask the first group to decide whether the words' letters are upper- or lowercase; the second group, whether the words rhyme with \"chair\"; and the third, whether they are animal names or not. Once the students are finished, I give them a memory test. Which group remembers the words best? Memory turns out to be much better in the third group, who processed the words in depth, at the meaning level (75 percent success), than in the other two groups, who processed the more superficial sensory aspects of the words, either at the letter level (33 percent success) or the rhyme level (52 percent success). We do find a weak implicit and unconscious trace of the words in all groups: learning leaves its subliminal mark within the spelling and phonological systems. However, only in-depth semantic processing guarantees explicit, detailed memory of the words. The same phenomenon occurs at the level of sentences: students who make the effort to understand sentences on their own, without teacher guidance, show much better retention of information. This is a general rule, which the American psychologist Henry Roediger states as follows: \"Making learning conditions more difficult, thus requiring students to engage more cognitive effort, often leads to enhanced retention.\"",

I ask the first group to decide whether the words' letters are upper- or lowercase; the second group, whether the words rhyme with \"chair\"; and the third, whether they are animal names or not. Once the students are finished, I give them a memory test. Which group remembers the words best? Memory turns out to be much better in the third group, who processed the words in depth, at the meaning level (75 percent success), than in the other two groups, who processed the more superficial sensory aspects of the words, either at the letter level (33 percent success) or the rhyme level (52 percent success). __________: learning leaves its subliminal mark within the spelling and phonological systems. However, only in-depth semantic processing guarantees explicit, detailed memory of the words. The same phenomenon occurs at the level of sentences: students who make the effort to understand sentences on their own, without teacher guidance, show much better retention of information. This is a general rule, which the American psychologist Henry Roediger states as follows: \"Making learning conditions more difficult, thus requiring students to engage more cognitive effort, often leads to enhanced retention.\"",

            "text": "In Britain, large open areas of land known as the commons were the property of landowning nobility but were accessible for use by peasants. They used the commons to conduct small-scale agriculture, collect wood for fuel and cooking, and raise small amounts of livestock for their families. As global demand for wool to be used in clothing and other goods increased, landowners sought more grazing land to increase wool production, so they privatized the commons, fencing them off and thus cutting off access to the peasants. By this process of the enclosure of the commons, peasants were cut off from land that had been their primary resource for survival for centuries. Today, there are interesting correlations between the physical commons of English pasturelands and the digital commons of the internet. Both are rich with opportunities for self-subsistence, expression, and flourishing; both are full of challenges from enclosure and landlords (e.g., platform owners who charge fees for access or use).",

Too often, we pretend to be listening while our mind is racing, trying to think of something clever. However, being clever is not being wise. In addition, to exacerbate our narcissistic tendencies, there is also the kind of listening with half an ear that presumes we already know what the other person is going to say. I am referring to inattentive listening, only waiting for a chance to speak, and even becoming impatient, wishing to get rid of the other person. As the philosopher and poet Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, \"There is a difference between truly listening and waiting for your turn to talk.\" This urge to interrupt and get a word in can be quite powerful. Some people just want to hear themselves speak to confirm and validate their existence. <u>큰 자아들은 작은 귀를 가졌다고 말해져 왔다</u>.",

Every time you harvest a crop and eat it, the nitrogen (and other nutrients) in those plants, the very nutrients that make that crop good food, are taken out of the soil and moved to wherever you are. Some of those nutrients accumulate in your body (if you are growing), but most pass through. Either way, unless you and your waste are returned to the farm, there is a net loss of nutrients from the soil — a net withdrawal from the nutrient bank. When there were relatively few people, most of whom lived, went to the bathroom, and died on or near the farm, leaving fields uncultivated or planting legumes and plowing them under was a reasonably sustainable way to produce food. But for eight billion people? Or for ten? The food required to feed all of us requires a lot of nitrogen to be removed from farms, and it needs to be replaced, or the soil bank account of nitrogen will run out. This means feeding the world requires industrially produced nitrogen fertilizer, at least for the foreseeable future, until we figure out a safe and effective way to return the nutrients passing through humans to the farm soil where they came. In other words, we thrive because of our innovations in capturing nitrogen.",

Every time you harvest a crop and eat it, the nitrogen (and other nutrients) in those plants, the very nutrients that make that crop good food, are taken out of the soil and moved to wherever you are. Some of those nutrients accumulate in your body (if you are growing), but most pass through. Either way, unless you and your waste are returned to the farm, there is a net loss of nutrients from the soil — a net withdrawal from the nutrient bank. When there were relatively few people, most of whom lived, went to the bathroom, and died on or near the farm, leaving fields uncultivated or planting legumes and plowing them under was a reasonably sustainable way to produce food. But for eight billion people? Or for ten? The food required to feed all of us requires a lot of nitrogen to be removed from farms, and it needs to be replaced, or the soil bank account of nitrogen will run out. This means feeding the world requires industrially produced nitrogen fertilizer, at least for the foreseeable future, until we figure out a safe and effective way to return the nutrients passing through humans to the farm soil where they came. In other words, we thrive because of our innovations in capturing nitrogen.",
